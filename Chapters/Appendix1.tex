\section{Shell model}

The idea that an atomic nucleus can have a structure that behaves rather similarly as the atom itself has been enforced by the experimental observations that were done across time. The sharp and discrete discontinuities of nuclear properties, such as the nucleon separation energy, point out that nucleus can be explained through the existence of \emph{shells}. Some examples of observations indicating this are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When adding a nucleon to a nucleus, there are certain places where the \emph{binding energy} of the next nucleon becomes considerably smaller than the previous one. 
    \item Separation energies for both the protons and neutrons suffer drastic changes, having strong deviations from the predictions of the semi-empirical mass formula \cite{weizsacker1935theorie}, the discontinuities being represented by major shell closures (complete filling) \cite{krane1991introductory}.
    \item The neutron absorption cross-section has a substantial decrease in value at the neutron magic numbers
    \item Great abundance of nuclides where $Z$ and $N$ are magic numbers.
\end{itemize}

The sudden discontinuities occur at specific values of the proton $Z$ and neutron $N$ numbers: these are called \emph{magic numbers}. Currently, these magic numbers correspond to $Z$ or $N=2,8,20,28,50,82,126$, and they represent the major shells. There are also two \emph{weakly magic numbers}: 40 and 64. One can examine the values for the first excited states $2^+$ that are shown in Figs. \ref{e2plus_proton}, \ref{e2plus_neutron}. Indeed, these values show some peaks, each peak corresponding to a particular magic number. This results are part of the work of Raman et al. \cite{raman2001transition}, where the transition probabilities from the ground state to the first-excited $2^+$ state in even-even nuclei were evaluated.

The shell model starts from the basic assumption that the nucleus is a \emph{mean-field potential}, where the motion of a single nucleon is caused by all the other nucleons. In other words, the nucleon is moving inside an average potential generated by all the other constituents of the nucleus. Of course that all the nucleons under the influence of this mean field occupy the energy levels which correspond to a series of sub-shells verifying the \textit{Pauli exclusion principle}. Having a general expression for the potential that reproduces all the magic numbers and the observed nuclear properties is therefore crucial. Since the model starts from the concept of independent (non-interacting) particle motion within an average potential, finding each energy will be equivalent of solving the Schrödinger equation:
\begin{align}
    -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla ^2\psi_i(r)+V(r)\psi_i(r)=e_i\psi_i(r)\, 
    \label{schrodinger-single-particle-eq}
\end{align}
where $e_i$ represents the energy (eigenvalue), $\psi_i$ represents the wave-function (eigenstates), and $V(r)$ is the nuclear potential whose expression must be evaluated. The choice of $V(r)$ will be dictated by the reproduction of various experimental data (such as nuclear saturation, scattering, nuclear reactions, and so on). For the motion of an independent particle, an obvious first attempt would be the \emph{simple harmonic oscillator} (SHO), which has the known expression:
\begin{align}
    V(r)=\frac{1}{2}m(\omega_i r)^2\ ,
    \label{harmonic-potential}
\end{align}
with $\omega_i$ as the frequency of the basic harmonic-like motion of the particle in the nucleus. With Eq. \ref{harmonic-potential}, the motion of the nucleon has a straightforward expression:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi_i(r)+\frac{1}{2}m(\omega r)^2\psi_i(r)=e_i\psi_i(r)\ .
\end{align}

This Schrödinger equation has its energy eigenvalues under to form:
\begin{align}
    e_N=\left(N+\frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega\ ,
\end{align}
where $N$ is the number of oscillator quanta which describes each major shell (also called the \emph{principal quantum number}). One should keep in mind that such an expression is typical for a three-dimensional and isotropic harmonic oscillator. The principal quantum number $N$ is furthermore defined as:
\begin{align}
    N=2(n-1)+l\ ,
\end{align}
with $n$ and $l$ being the \emph{radial} quantum number and \emph{orbital angular momentum} quantum number, respectively, taking values $n=1,2,3,\dots$ and $l=0,1,2,\dots,n-1$. In this first approximation, all the levels with the same principal quantum number $N$ are \emph{degenerate}, with a maximal degeneracy given by $2(2l+1)$. However, by using only the SHO term as the expression of $V(r)$, only the first three magic numbers are reproduced, meaning that some additional term(s) might be needed in order to consistently obtain the series of magic numbers.

Furthermore, the steepness of the SHO can be corrected with an \emph{attractive} term proportional to $l$-squared. This acts as a centrifugal term which provides an angular momentum barrier, lifting the degeneracy between the levels with the same principal quantum number $N$ and different values for the orbital angular momentum $l$. This SHO+$l^2$ adjustment is still not enough, such that a so-called \emph{spin-orbit} coupling term of the form $\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}$ must be also added. This term comes from the consideration that the nucleon-nucleon interaction has a spin dependence, and the potential depends on the intrinsic spin $s$ ($\vec{s}$) and the orbital angular momentum $l$ ($\vec{l}$) of a nucleon. Since $\vec{j}=\vec{l}+\vec{s}$, two possible states emerge from a single value of $l$ (depending on wether $\vec{s}$ is parallel or anti-parallel to $\vec{l}$). The final will consist of the \emph{Modified Harmonic Oscillator} (MHO).
\begin{align}
    V(r)=\frac{1}{2}(\omega r)^2+B\ \vec{l}^2+A\ \vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\ .
    \label{modified-harmonic-oscillator-eq}
\end{align}

For the sake of simplicity, the centrifugal term will be denoted within formulas without the vector symbol. Since the intrinsic spin of a nucleon is $s=1/2$, for a given value of $l$, there can be two values for the \emph{total angular momentum} (a.m.) $j=l\pm1/2$: one for each spin orientation with respect to the direction of the orbital a.m. Moreover, for every value of $l=0,1,2,3,4,\dots$, there is a similar notation $l=s,p,d,f,g,\dots$, respectively. Regarding the spectroscopic notation, usually, the value of $j$ is considered as a subscript; $nl_j$ (for example $1p_{1/2}$ and $1p_{3/2}$). For high enough shells, there can be splittings between $j+1/2$ and $j-1/2$ that are large enough to lower the $j+1/2$ state from one oscillator shell $n$ to one located below $n-1$. These types of levels are called \emph{intruder states}, and they have opposite parity $\pi=(-1)^l$ with respect to the shell that these levels will occupy.

Going back to the expression of the $\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}$ term from Eq. \ref{modified-harmonic-oscillator-eq} and denoting it with $V_{ls}(r)$, its contribution to the total potential can be regarded as a surface effect and it can be expressed as a function that depends on the radial coordinate as such \cite{casten2000nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    V_{ls}(r)=-a_{ls}\frac{\partial V(r)}{\partial r}\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\ ,
\end{align}
where $V(r)$ is the expression for a central potential and $a_{ls}$ is a strength constant.

The nuclear potential is now able to reproduce all the magic numbers. It is also possible to formulate the total energy of a single-particle within the average potential. Thus, the Hamiltonian of this simple system (i.e., the MHO) can be formulated as such:
\begin{align}
    H&=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+V_\text{SHO}+(l^2)_\text{term}+(\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s})_\text{term}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+V_\text{MHO} , \nonumber\\
    H&=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+\frac{1}{2}m(\omega r)^2+Bl^2+A\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\ .
\end{align}

The evolution from a SHO, then SHO+$l^2$, and finally SHO+$l^2+\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}$ or modified oscillator potential is illustrated in Fig. \ref{energy-levels-mho}, where it can be seen how each extra term removes a degeneracy, with the complete reproduction of the magic numbers in the third column. The \emph{intruder} levels can also be observed, where states with $j=l+1/2$ from a particular $n$ are so low, that they lie below an $n-1$ adjacent level.

    \label{energy-levels-mho}
\end{figure}

Another, more realistic potential that can be used in order to reproduce the specific shell model calculation is the so-called Woods-Saxon potential. Because of the short-range character of the strong nuclear force, it is safe to assume that this potential should behave in the same manner as the density distribution of the nucleons. Since for medium and heavy nuclei, the Fermi-like functions (distributions) are the ones that best fit the experimentally measured data, this potential should have the following form \cite{woods1954diffuse}:
\begin{align}
    V_\text{ws}(r)=-\frac{V_0}{1+e^{\frac{r-R_0}{a}}}\ ,
    \label{woods-saxon-potential}
\end{align}
where $V_0$ represents the depth of the potential ($\approx 50$ MeV, in order to reproduce the experimental separation energies for the nucleons), $a$ is the surface thickness (or \emph{diffuseness parameter}, giving information about how fast the potential drops to zero) with a value of approximately $0.5$ fm, and $R_0$ is the nuclear radius ($R_0=1.2A^{1/3}\ \text{fm}$). The nature of this potential is of \emph{central type} and Eq. \ref{woods-saxon-potential} is not enough the reproduce the higher magic numbers. As such, the addition of a spin-orbit term, similarly as in the case of MHO potential, is required \cite{martin2017particle}: 
\begin{align}
    V_\text{total}=V_\text{ws}^\text{central}+V_{ls}(r)\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\ .
    \label{woods-saxon-so-potential}
\end{align}
The only good quantum numbers in the case of the WS potential are the total a.m. $j$ and the parity $\pi=(-1)^l$.
The expectation value of the spin-orbit term $\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}$ can be given as:
\begin{align}
    \langle ls \rangle=\hbar^2\begin{cases}
        \frac{l}{2} \quad &\text{for} j=l+\frac{1}{2}\\
        -\frac{l+1}{2} &\text{for} j=l-\frac{1}{2}\ \\
    \end{cases}\ .
\end{align}
and the spacing between two levels can be furthermore expressed as \cite{martin2017particle}:
\begin{align}
    \Delta E_{ls}=\frac{2l+1}{2}\hbar^2\langle V_{ls}\rangle\ .
\end{align}
The experimental evidence points to the fact that $V_{ls}(r)$ is negative, meaning that states with $j=l-1/2$ are shifted higher than $j=l+1/2$. Some characteristics of the WS potential are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It increases with the increase of $R$, meaning that it has an \emph{attractive nature}
    \item It flattens out for large enough $A$ in the center of the nucleus
    \item It rapidly goes to zero as $R$ increases (given by the diffuseness parameter), indicating its short-range nature
    \item When $R=R_0$ (that is for the nucleons near the surface), a large force towards the center of the nucleus is experienced by the these nucleons.
\end{enumerate}

    \label{woods-saxon-plot}
\end{figure}

The Hamiltonian that describes the motion of the nucleon within the mean-field potential is given by:
\begin{align}
    %H&=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+V_\text{ws}^\text{central}+(\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s})_\text{term}\ ,\\
    H&=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2-\frac{V_0}{1+e^{\frac{r-R_0}{a}}}+A\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\ ,
\end{align}
and the shape of a typical Woods-Saxon potential is shown in Fig. \ref{woods-saxon-plot}. A comparison between the Woods-Saxon potential, a SHO, and the square-well-like potential is made in Fig \ref{shell-model-functional-potentials}. The difference between the pure form of the Woods-Saxon potential and the total potential amended with the spin-orbit contribution can be seen in Fig. \ref{woods-saxon-energy-levels}.

So far, the general discussion concerning nuclear models was made for the case where each nucleon is treated as an \emph{independent} particle moving in an average (mean-field) potential. However, such an assumption is not accurate enough (especially for the nuclei that lie far away from the closed shells), and this problem should be treated within a \emph{many-body} approach: considering the mutual interaction between the nucleons. These interactions are also called \emph{residual interactions} \cite{casten2000nuclear,bertulani2007nuclear}. With these residual interactions, an accurate depiction of the nucleus might be achieved. The \emph{Deformed Shell Model} will be employed in the following sections, reaching to the famous Nilsson model of describing the nucleus.
