\chapter{Introduction}

Ground-state nuclear shapes with spherical or axial symmetry are predominant across the char of nuclides. Near closed shells, the deformation is sufficient that models based on spherical symmetries can be used to describe nuclear properties (e.g., energies, quadrupole moments, and so on). Besides the spherical and axially-symmetric shapes, the existence of triaxial nuclear deformation was theoretically predicted a long time ago \cite{bohr1998nuclear}. The rigid triaxiality of nuclei is defined by the asymmetry parameter $\gamma$, giving rise to a unique behavior concerning the system dynamics. Lately, triaxial nuclei drew a lot of attention within the nuclear physics community, since the description of nuclear properties represents a real challenge from an experimental and also a theoretical standpoint. A great progress for towards experimental setups being able to perform measurements of high-spin has only been possible after the 2000s. It is worth mentioning that some experiments regarding alpha-$\alpha$ particle reactions induced in heavy nuclei in the early 1960s (e.g., \cite{morinaga1963gamma}) helped to produce decent amount of data for the rotational in the high-spin region ($\geq 20 \hbar$).

The physics of \emph{high-spin} states has been studied from the early 1950s, with the major breakthrough on the theoretical side made by Bohr and Mottelson \cite{bohr1998nuclear}. The nuclear rotation was described in terms of the rotational degrees of freedom associated with other nuclear degrees of freedom such as particle-vibration, quadrupole-quadrupole, parity, and so on. The spherical shell-model only describes nuclei near the closed shells. On the other side, for the nuclei that lie far from closed shells, a deformed potential must be employed. In the case of even-even nuclei, unique band structures resulting from the vibrations and rotations of the nuclear surface appear in the energy range 0-2 MeV. 

Even though triaxiality has an elusive character, two phenomena, i.e., wobbling motion and chiral bands are uniquely attributed to triaxial shapes. Consequently, these two were intensively searched by using the advanced techniques. In this work, the focus is given exclusively on the first effect, although it is worth specifying that current team provides a unified description of both phenomena in their most recent work \cite{raduta2022simultaneous}, which stands out as the first ever theoretical treatment describing wobbling and chirality on an equal footing.

Quantized wobbling modes were firstly discovered experimentally in $^{163}$Lu, where the presence of the odd-proton $i_{13/2}$ grants the apparition of multiple rotational bands to appear around the yrast line. This experiment consisted of populating high-spin states with a $^{29}$Si beam interacting with a thin target of $^{139}$La. Later on, other odd-$A$ nuclei were discovered as exhibiting wobbling excitations, and all the experimental findings will be mentioned in the following chapters. The nuclei having a triaxial shape can rotate about any of the principal axes, causing rich collective spectra to emerge. The family of rotational bands is described in terms of vibrational excitations. As a classical analog, nuclear wobbling motion is corresponds to the spinning motion of an asymmetric top. The experimental fingerprints for wobbling motion indicate that the energy spectrum behaves as $\sim I(I+1)$ with respect to the angular momentum, there is a clear dominance of electric transitions over the magnetic ones, and the nuclei have large quadrupole moments. All these quantities will be exploited in detail in the coming chapters.

\section{Aim}
 
The objective of this research is two-fold. On one side, the theoretical description of wobbling motion is treated in detail, starting from the required nuclear models specific to deformed nuclei, and reaching a set of key properties of the phenomenon. Differences between wobbling that occurs in odd- but also even-mass nuclei are depicted, since each situation manifests in remarkable ways. Once the general formalism behind this effect is presented, an inventory of all the currently identified nuclei will be made, providing clear explanations for the band structure and also the relevant parameters describing deformation. The experimental measurements will be addressed for each nucleus in particular, concluding with a chart that contains these nuclides. The complete overview of all existing wobbling nuclei is in fact one of the unique features of the research and a first within literature.

The second objective of this present work is to describe the wobbling mechanism by means of a novel semi-classical approach. Indeed, the important quantities related to collective excitations are properly reproduced by the, i.e., excitation energies, quadrupole moments, transition probabilities and many more. This model starts from an initial quantal Hamiltonian that is dequantized through a variational method. A set of classical equations of motion that describe triaxial nuclei are obtained, and a classical energy function is granted by the approach. This function is a remarking feature of the developed framework, as this fully analytical expression (containing only classical variables that were obtained via the dequantization) will provide an insight into multiple analyses: energy spectrum, stability of the wobbling motion, critical regions, phase transitions and even possible changes in the wobbling regime. 

Another remarking feature of the current model is the geometrical interpretation of the rotational motion specific to triaxial nuclei, which is described in both a two- and also three-dimensional space. Also unique to this research are the introduction of two concepts that are related to the band structures of odd-mass nuclei, namely the Signature Partner Bands and Parity Partner Bands. These two characteristics, which will be detailed in dedicated chapters, can be considered as hallmarks of the theory. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that throughout this entire work, a consistent graphical representation is adopted, giving workflow diagrams, schematics, and charts, with the purpose of providing clearer explanations (where possible) of the underlying mechanisms.

\section{Motivation}

Over the years, many theoretical interpretations were suggested for the description of the wobbling motion and its main features. The Triaxial Rotor Model \cite{bohr1998nuclear,davydov1958rotational} and the Particle Rotor Model \cite{hamamoto2002wobbling} are quantal models that are solved exactly in the laboratory frame. Other investigations are based on mean-field theories, such as the Random Phase Approximation \cite{shimizu1995nuclear}, the Angular Momentum Projection \cite{oi2000wobbling}, and also the Collective Hamiltonian \cite{chen2014collective} were adopted.

In this research, one aimed at a semi-classical description of the wobbling phenomenon due to its advantage in keeping a close contact with the `classical picture' of the system dynamics. Certainly, working with a set of classical equations of motion is much easier than having to deal with quantum mechanical objects that to not have a clear one-to-one correspondence with classical mechanics. It will be shown that the rotational motion of a triaxial nucleus can be approximated quite well with that of a rigid rotator, meaning that the energy spectrum could be accurately described through quantities that have concise physical meaning (i.e., moments  of inertia, angular momentum, angular frequency). Moreover, the analytical spectrum that is achieved by solving the equations for an odd-mass nucleus is indeed remarkable, since it will be described by separated degrees of freedom associated to an even-even core and a valence nucleon that interacts with core. The variational method that is employed proves to be an efficient tool in accurately depict the energy spectra and transition probabilities of several odd-$A$ nuclei within the $A=160$ mass region.

The lack of studies of geometrical treatments for the wobbling motion encouraged the team to pursue such an analysis. A two-dimensional evaluation shows if regions of stability exists, meaning that one can identify the energies at which the total angular momentum exhibits stable precessional motion. Taking the formalism a step further, the wobbling motion is explored within the space generated by the three components of the total angular momentum. The two constants of motion, i.e., the total energy and the total spin are graphically represented in the same picture, and their intersection signify the allowed trajectories that the angular momentum precesses around. Each trajectory corresponds to a particular set of spin and energies, meaning that the entire spectrum of a wobbling nucleus can be interpreted. Using the classical view of the angular momentum and the total energy for a triaxial ellipsoid represents the onset of a fully unified description for nuclear deformation. Moreover, this phenomenological and semi-classical model gives results that are on par with fully microscopic or quantal descriptions (much more complex), making it a successful tool in describing collective phenomena.

This thesis is structured in the following way. Starting of, in Chapter \ref{chapter-2} the nuclear surface is described using the expansion in terms of collective coordinates and spherical harmonics. The relevant multipole modes are presented and a focus is given on the quadrupole $\lambda=2$ excitation mode. This is the main vibrational mode that causes deformation of the nucleonic matter. Within the approximation of the nuclear surface, the deformation parameters $\beta_2$ and $\gamma$ are introduced, which give a direct insight with respect to the degree of elongation and asymmetry between the ellipsoid axes.
