\chapter{Introduction}

Besides the spherical and axially-symmetric shapes, the existence of nuclear deformation was theoretically predicted a long time ago \cite{bohr1998nuclear}. Spherical nuclei are quite rare across the chart of nuclides. Near closed shells, the deformation is indeed sufficient that models based on spherical symmetries can be used to describe nuclear properties (e.g., energies, quadrupole moments, and so on).
