In order to understand nuclei in terms of their shape and to get a grasp on how deformation plays a major role in affecting the dynamics of nuclear matter, it is necessary to introduce a few definitions and theoretical models. These will represent fundamental \emph{tools} in the development of the formalism, which will be presented later on. It is rather intuitive that a key characteristic related to the size and shape of the nucleus is its radius. Therefore, the first section aims at giving an insight on the nuclear radius and how it can be approximated, showing that different approximations lead to specific types of deformations. Moreover, a realistic description of nuclei would require a time-dependent behavior of their surface, i.e., via surface vibrations or surface oscillations. They will be covered as well throughout this chapter.% These oscillations near the surface give, on average, a stable overall shape.

As an outline of this chapter, the parametrization of nuclear shapes and deformations will be detailed in Section \ref{nuclear-shapes}, while Section \ref{section-nuclear-models} will cover the fundamental features of some nuclear models. Lastly, Section \ref{section-triaxial-signatures} will introduce the unique characteristics of nuclei lacking symmetry in regards to their equilibrium shape. A set of conclusions that emerge from all sections will be inferred at the end of the chapter.

\section{Shape of Nuclei}
\label{nuclear-shapes}

The nuclear surface can be described through an expansion of the spherical harmonics with some time-dependent parameters as \emph{expansion coefficients}. The expression of the nuclear shape is given as \cite{greiner1996nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    R(\theta,\varphi,t)=R_0\left(1+\sum_{\lambda=0}^\infty\sum_{-\lambda}^\lambda\alpha_{\lambda\mu}(t)Y_\lambda^\mu(\theta,\varphi)\right)\ ,
    \label{nuclear-shape}
\end{align}
where $R$ denotes the nuclear radius. The radius is given as a function of spherical coordinates $\theta,\varphi$ and time. The radius of the spherical nucleus when all the expansion coefficients vanish is denoted by $R_0$. It is worth mentioning that the expansion coefficients $\alpha_{\lambda\mu}$ act as \emph{collective coordinates}, since the time-dependent amplitudes describe the vibrations of the nuclear surface. This will be also re-iterated in Section \ref{bohr-hamiltonian} from this chapter.

% \subsection{Nuclear radius under rotation}

% To get a grasp at the physical meaning behind the deformation parameters that are used to describe the nuclear surface, it is instructive to see what happens when the system undergoes a rotation transformation.

% The function $R(\theta,\varphi)$ describes the original (non-rotated) nuclear shape. Rotating the system will result in the change of the angular coordinates $(\theta,\varphi)$ to $(\theta',\varphi')$, which will correspond to a new function $R'(\theta',\varphi')$. Moreover, both nuclear surfaces (i.e., the non-rotated and the rotated one) must hold the equality:
% \begin{align}
%     R'(\theta',\varphi')=R(\theta,\varphi)
% \end{align}

% The rotational invariance of $R$ employs that $R'(\theta,\varphi)$ must have the same functional form, but the expansion coefficients $\alpha_{\lambda\mu}$ must be rotated, meaning:
% \begin{align}
%     \sum_{\lambda\mu}\alpha_{\lambda\mu}'Y'_{\lambda\mu}(
%         \theta,\varphi)=\sum_{\lambda\mu}\alpha_{\lambda\mu}Y_{\lambda\mu}(
%             \theta,\varphi)\ . \label{nuclear_surface_equality}
% \end{align}

% Note that in Eq. \ref{nuclear_surface_equality}, the spherical harmonics $Y'_{\lambda\mu}$ are obtained via the usual rotation matrices. Finally, the invariance of Eq. \ref{nuclear-shape} is achieved if the set of parameters $\alpha_{\lambda\mu}$ transform similarly to a \emph{spherical tensor with angular momentum} $\lambda$ \cite{ring2004nuclear}, that is:
% \begin{align}
%     \alpha_{\lambda\mu}'=\sum_{\mu'}\mathcal{D}^{(\lambda)}_{\mu\mu'}\alpha_{\lambda\mu'}\ .
% \end{align}

% Besides the spherical tensor character, the collective coordinates also have the following properties (emerging from Eq. \ref{nuclear-shape}):
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Complex Conjugation.
%     \begin{align}
%         Y^*_{\lambda\mu}(\theta,\varphi)&=(-1)^{\mu}Y_{\lambda-\mu}(\theta,\varphi), \\
%         \alpha^*_{\lambda\mu}&=(-1)^\mu\alpha_{\lambda-\mu}\ .
%     \end{align}
%     \item Parity - the coordinates $\alpha_{\lambda\mu}$ must undergo the same change of sign under a parity transformation as the spherical harmonics, in order to keep the invariance of the nuclear surface.
%     \begin{align}
%         (r,\theta,\varphi) &\xrightarrow[P]{}     (r,\pi-\theta,\pi+\varphi)\ \nonumber, \\
%         Y_{\lambda\mu}(\theta,\varphi) &\xrightarrow[P]{} Y_{\lambda\mu}(\pi-\theta,\pi+\varphi)=(-1)^\lambda Y_{\lambda\mu}(\theta,\varphi)\ .\nonumber
%     \end{align}
%     Therefore, the parity of the expansion coefficients are:
%     \begin{align}
%         \pi(\alpha_{\lambda\mu})=(-1)^\lambda\ .
%     \end{align}
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Multipole deformations}

In the expansion of the nuclear radius defined by Eq. 
\ref{nuclear-shape}, the different values for $\lambda$ will determine different effects regarding the physical aspects of the nucleus. As such, the first values of $\lambda$ will be examined in terms of their physical meaning.
\begin{description}
    \item[Monopole mode] This corresponds to the first value of $\lambda=0$. This is the simplest mode of \emph{deformation} of a nuclear surface. Within this approximation, the spherical harmonic $Y_0^0$ is constant, which would imply that any non-vanishing values for $\alpha_{00}$ will correspond to the change in radius of the nucleus. This kind of excitation is also called \emph{breathing mode} of the nucleus \cite{greiner1996nuclear,bohr1998nuclear}. The energy required for this kind of excitation mode is very large, since it implies a compression of the nuclear matter, making this mode irrelevant in the low-lying excited spectra of atomic nuclei.
    \item[Dipole mode] Corresponds to $\lambda=1$. In reality, this type of mode does not manifest itself as a deformation of the nucleus, but rather as a shift of the nuclear center of mass.
    \item[Quadrupole mode] Excited mode that correspond to $\lambda=2$ are the most important collective excitations. The loss of axial symmetry, triaxial deformations, and other shape-specific features are direct consequences of quadrupole excitations.
    \item[Octupole mode] It corresponds to $\lambda=3$, representing the main asymmetric excitations of a nucleus with states of negative-parity. The specific shape of a nuclear system governed by octuple deformations is similar to that of a pear.
    \item[Hexadecapole deformations] Excitations with $\lambda=4$ are considered the highest angular momenta which can provide relevant information for the nuclear phenomena. Currently, there is no clear evidence for pure excitations with hexadecapole nature, however, these excitations seem to have a major role in the admixture to quadrupole excitations for the ground-state shape of heavy nuclei \cite{greiner1996nuclear}.
\end{description}

The multipole deformations for the cases $\lambda=1,2,3$ and $\lambda=4$ are shown in Fig. \ref{multipole-deformations}. Excitations with higher angular momentum than these have no practical application within the study of atomic nuclei. Moreover, one can also see that there is an intrinsic limitation on the maximal value of $\lambda$, which dictates the individual bumps of the surface (see Fig. \ref{multipole-deformations}). These bumps are described by the spherical harmonics $Y_\lambda^\mu$, and they decrease in size with increasing values of $\lambda$, but with the physical limitation given by the size of the nucleon diameter.
\begin{figure}

    \caption{Graphical representation of the first few modes of excitations of the nuclear surface. The figure is taken from Ref. \cite{greiner1996nuclear}.}
    \label{multipole-deformations}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Quadrupole Deformation}
\label{section:quadrupole-deformation}

One of the most important excitation modes (vibrational degrees of freedom) is the quadrupole deformation, corresponding to $\lambda=2$. In the case of pure quadrupole deformation, the nuclear surface will be given by the following expression:
\begin{align}
    R(\theta,\varphi)=R\left(1+\sum_{\mu=-2}^{2}\alpha_{2\mu}Y_2^\mu(\theta,\varphi)\right)\ . \label{quadrupole-surface}
\end{align}

From this expression, the term $\alpha_{00}$ is of second order in $\alpha_{2\mu}$ and it can be neglected further on. This term also reflects the conservation of volume \cite{greiner1996nuclear,ring2004nuclear}. The real and independent degrees of freedom from the above expression are: $\alpha_{20}$, the real and imaginary parts of $\alpha_{21}$, and the real and imaginary parts of $\alpha_{22}$. More insight in regards to the quadrupole shape of the nucleus can be achieved if one expresses $R$ in terms of Cartesian coordinates. The spherical harmonics will attain a new form, depending on the Cartesian components of the unit vector pointing in a direction defined by $(\theta,\varphi)$:
\begin{align}
    \xi=\sin\theta\cos\varphi\ ,\ \eta=\sin\theta\sin\varphi\ ,\ \zeta=\cos\theta\ ,
\end{align}
with the condition $\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2=1$. With the expressions of the spherical harmonics as functions of $(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$, the nuclear radius will change accordingly. A relationship between the Cartesian components and the spherical ones for the deformation can be also obtained if all coefficients $\alpha_{2\mu}$ are written as functions of $\alpha_{ij}$ (with $i,j=\xi,\eta,\zeta$). Since the Cartesian deformations give the stretch/contraction of the nucleus in a given direction, a first interpretation of the physical meaning behind the parameters $\alpha_{2\mu}$ can be established:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha_{20}$: describes the stretching of the $z$ axis with respect to the $y$ and $x$ axes.
    \item $\alpha_{2-2}$ and $\alpha_{22}$: give the relative length of the $x$ axis compared to the $y$ axis. Moreover, it also gives the oblique deformation in the $x-y$ plane.
    \item $\alpha_{2-1}$ and $\alpha_{21}$: describe an oblique deformation, but with respect to the $z$ axis.
\end{itemize}

With the set of parameters defined above, the shape and orientation of the nucleus can have arbitrary values (the coefficients $\alpha_{2\mu}$ are mixing the shape and orientation), making the parametrization somewhat problematic. In order to fix that, the geometry can be changed if one considers the \emph{principal axis system}
% (the PA reference system is a coordinate system in which the moments of inertia associated with the nucleus are diagonal). 
When using this reference frame, the number of parameters is still unchanged, however their physical significance becomes clearer. By denoting the new coordinate system with primed letters, the nuclear radius will be described as a function $R=R(\xi',\eta',\zeta')$, with the conditions that $\alpha'_{ij}=0\ ,\ i\neq j$. The condition will further imply that the newly expressed parameters ($\alpha'_{2\mu}$) have the following form:
\begin{align}
    \alpha'_{2 \pm 1}&=0\ , \nonumber \\
    \alpha'_{2 \pm 2}&\equiv a_2\ , \nonumber \\
    \alpha'_{20}&\equiv a_0\ ,
\end{align}
where the conveniently denoted terms $a_2$ and $a_0$ depend on the Cartesian components $\alpha_{\xi,\xi}\ ,\ \alpha_{\eta,\eta}\ ,\ \alpha_{\zeta,\zeta}$. From this set of equations the physical significance of the five real and independent parameters is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a_0$ is indicating the stretch of $z'$ axis w.r.t. the $x'$ and $y'$ axes.
    \item $a_2$ is indicating the asymmetry between the lengths of $x'$ and $y'$ axes, respectively.
    \item the three \emph{Euler angles} $\mathbf{\Theta}=(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$ that determine the orientation of the PA system $(x',y',z')$ with respect to the laboratory-fixed frame $(x,y,z)$.
\end{itemize}

The advantage in working within this coordinate system is clearly emphasized: rotation and shape vibration degrees of freedom are completely separated. A change in the Euler angles will emerge as a pure rotation of the nucleus, while a change in shape will be affected exclusively by the $a_0$ and $a_2$ parameters. If $a_2=0$, then the nucleus has is symmetric around the $z$-axis (equal lengths along the $x$ and $y$ directions). Another way of describing the excitations of quadrupole type is to adopt the parameters introduced by Bohr in Ref. \cite{bohr1954rotational}. These two parameters can be viewed as a set of polar coordinates in the space generated by $a_0$ and $a_2$, namely:
\begin{align}
    a_0&=\beta_2\cos\gamma\ , \nonumber \\
    a_2&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\beta_2\sin\gamma\ ,
    \label{bohr-deformation-params}
\end{align}
where the numeric factor $1/\sqrt{2}$ was added such that the following relation holds true:
\begin{align}
    \sum_\mu\left|\alpha_{2\mu}\right|^2=\sum_\mu\left|\alpha'_{2\mu}\right|^2=a_0^2+2a_2^2=\beta_2^2\ .
    \label{quadrupole-param-sum}
\end{align}

It is worth mentioning that Eq. \ref{quadrupole-param-sum} is rotationally invariant, having the same value in the laboratory and the principal axes systems. Now that the shape of the nucleus (i.e., the nuclear surface radius $R$) can be described consistently with the parameters defined in Eq. \ref{bohr-deformation-params}, one can calculate the stretching of the nuclear radius along any of the directions is given in terms of $(\beta,\gamma)$ as follows:
\begin{align}
    \delta R_k=\sqrt{\frac{5}{4\pi}}\beta\cos(\gamma-\frac{2\pi k}{3})\ .
    \label{axes-stretching}
\end{align}

\subsection{Axial quadrupole deformations}

Using this set of new coordinates, the expression of the nuclear radius for axially quadrupole-deformed nuclei is given as:
\begin{align}
    R(\theta,\varphi)=R_0\left(1+\beta_2 Y_2^0(\theta,\varphi)\right)\ ,
    \label{quadrupole-radius}
\end{align}
where the parameter $\beta_2$ is called the \emph{quadrupole deformation parameter}, and its value dictates whether the nucleus is \emph{oblate} (i.e., a flattened sphere), \emph{prolate} (i.e., an elongated sphere, like a rugby ball), or \emph{spherical}. The nuclear shapes that are characterized only by $\beta_2$ (i.e., $\gamma=0$) have shapes that correspond to spheroids. These shapes are axially symmetric, meaning that they only have one deformed axis. For the axially-symmetric quadrupole deformations, the parameter $\beta_2$ can be related to the axes of the spheroid via Eq. \ref{axes-stretching}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Chapters/Figures/nuclear-radius-elongation.pdf}
    \caption{Graphical representation with the stretching of the nuclear axes $\delta R_k\ ,\ k=1,2,3$, corresponding to the increase in axis lengths along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions. The representation used an arbitrary value $\beta_2=0.3$. Figure was reproduced according to the calculations done in Ref. \cite{greiner1996nuclear}.}
    \label{nuclear-radius-elongation}
\end{figure}

Taking a look at Fig. \ref{nuclear-radius-elongation}, one can see the variations of the three axes with respect to $\gamma$. When $\gamma=0^\circ$, the nucleus is elongated along the $z'$ axis, but the $x'$ and $y'$ axes are identical (the prolate case). As $\gamma$ increases, the $x'$ axis grows, while the other two axes decrease in size, making a region with \emph{triaxial shapes}. Symmetry is reached again at $\gamma=60^\circ$, where $x'$ and $z'$ axes are equal but longer than $y'$ axis, making the nucleus look like a flattened shape (the oblate case). This pattern is repeated every $\gamma=60^\circ$, where alternating prolate/oblate shapes occur. It is possible to summarize the various nuclear shapes with a graphical representation within in the $(\beta,\gamma)$ plane. In Fig. \ref{beta-gamma-plane} one can the oblate shapes at $\gamma=60^\circ,180^\circ,300^\circ$, while prolate shapes appear at $\gamma=0^\circ,120^\circ,240^\circ$.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/beta_gamma_plane.pdf}
    \caption{Beta-gamma plane divided into six regions. The part delimited from $\gamma=0^\circ$ to $\gamma=60^\circ$ can be considered as the representative one, while others can be reproduced from this interval.}
    \label{beta-gamma-plane}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Non-Axial quadrupole deformations}

Besides the nuclei characterized by a \emph{spheroidal} shape where two of the principal axes are equal, there are also \emph{triaxial} (or non-axial) nuclei. The triaxial shapes are defined by the $\gamma$ degree of freedom: a parameter which dictates the asymmetry between the three axes of the nucleus (e.g., it describes a stretching along an axis that is perpendicular to the symmetry axis). The nuclear radius for the axially-asymmetric quadrupole deformations is given by:
\begin{align}
    R(\theta,\varphi)=R_0\left(1+\beta_2\cos\gamma Y_2^0(\theta,\varphi)+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sin\gamma(Y_2^2(\theta,\varphi)+Y_2^{-2}(\theta,\varphi))\right)\ ,
    \label{non-axial-quadrupole}
\end{align}
which is different from Eq. \ref{quadrupole-radius}. The values $\gamma=0^\circ$ and $\gamma=60^\circ$ correspond to symmetric prolate and oblate shapes, respectively. Between these values, the triaxial region exist, with \emph{maximal triaxiality} reached at $\gamma=30^\circ$. The deformation parameters $(\beta,\gamma)$ are also called the Hill-Wheeler set \cite{wong2008introductory}. In Eq. \ref{non-axial-quadrupole}, the spherical harmonics are expressed as follows:
\begin{align}
    Y_2^0(\theta,\varphi)&=\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\frac{5}{\pi}}\left(3\cos^2\theta-1\right)\ , \nonumber\\
    Y_2^2(\theta,\varphi)&=\frac{1}{4}e^{2i\varphi}\sqrt{\frac{15}{2\pi}}\sin^2\theta\ ,\nonumber\\
    Y_2^{-2}(\theta,\varphi)&=\frac{1}{4}e^{-2i\varphi}\sqrt{\frac{15}{2\pi}}\sin^2\theta\ ,
\end{align}
and substituting these terms in $R(\theta,\varphi)$, the structure Eq. \ref{non-axial-quadrupole} will become \cite{andersson1976nuclear,bohr1998nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    R(\theta,\varphi)=R_0\left[1+\sqrt{\frac{5}{16\pi}}\beta\left(\cos\gamma(3\cos^2\theta-1)+\sqrt{3}\sin\gamma\sin^2\theta\cos2\varphi\right)\right]\ .
\end{align}

Regarding the nuclear shapes that were described in Fig. \ref{beta-gamma-plane}, the redundancies of the $(\beta,\gamma)$ variables are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for $\beta_2>0$ the nucleus is \emph{prolate} for $\gamma=0^\circ,120^\circ,240^\circ$.
    \item for $\beta_2>0$ the nucleus is \emph{oblate} for $\gamma=60^\circ,180^\circ,300^\circ$.
    \item for $\gamma=0^\circ,180^\circ$, the symmetry axis is the $z$-axis of the intrinsic frame
    \item for $\gamma=120^\circ,300^\circ$, the symmetry axis is the $x$-axis of the intrinsic frame
    \item for $\gamma=60^\circ,240^\circ$, the symmetry axis is the $y$-axis of the intrinsic frame
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lund Convention}
\label{subsection:lund-convention}

The so-called Lund convention \cite{andersson1976nuclear} somewhat solves this repetitiveness, by selecting a rotational axis according to the set of rules described below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The quadrupole deformation parameter $\beta_2$ is always positive: $\beta_2\geq 0 $
    \item The rotation around the smallest axis ($s$-axis) implies the constraint on the triaxiality parameter $0^\circ\leq\gamma\leq60^\circ$.
    \item The rotation around the longest axis ($l$-axis) implies the constraint on the triaxiality parameter $-120^\circ\leq\gamma\leq-60^\circ$.
    \item The rotation around the medium/intermediate axis ($i$-axis) implies the constraint on the triaxiality parameter $-60^\circ\leq\gamma\leq 0^\circ$.
\end{itemize}

% Fig. \ref{lund-convention-graph} aims at depicting the mechanism behind the Lund convention. The graphical representations organized in Table \ref{table-ellipsoidal-shapes} show the possible nuclear shapes, depending on the number of deformation axes; namely, if there is only one deformation axis, then the nuclear shape is \emph{axial-symmetric} (oblate or prolate) and if there are two deformation axes, then the nucleus is \emph{triaxial} (axially-asymmetric).

%     \label{table-ellipsoidal-shapes}
% \end{table}

Considering the Lund convention and the Eq. \ref{axes-stretching}, one can re-write the set of stretching values as follows:
\begin{align}
    \frac{R_x-R_0}{R_0}&=\sqrt{\frac{5}{4\pi}}\beta_2\cos\left(\gamma-\frac{2}{3}\pi\right)\ , \\
    \frac{R_y-R_0}{R_0}&=\sqrt{\frac{5}{4\pi}}\beta_2\cos\left(\gamma-\frac{4}{3}\pi\right)\ , \\
    \frac{R_z-R_0}{R_0}&=\sqrt{\frac{5}{4\pi}}\beta_2\cos\gamma. \\
\end{align}

For the axially symmetric deformation (i.e., $\gamma=0$), the quadrupole parameter $\beta_2$ can be derived as follows:
\begin{align}
    \beta_2=\frac{4}{3}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{5}}\frac{R_z-R_x}{R_0}\ ,
\end{align}
where $R_z-R_x$ is the difference between the major ($R_z$) and minor ($R_x$) axes of the ellipsoid. This equation for $\beta_2$ shows how for oblate deformations, $\beta_2<0$ (implying that $R_z<R_x$), while for prolate deformations $\beta_2>0$ (implying that $R_z>R_x$). Within literature, usual values for $\beta_2$ range from 0.2 - 0.3 (known as \emph{normal deformation}) to 0.4 - 0.6 (known as strong or \emph{superdeformation}). Very often, an alternative description of the nuclear deformation is used in terms of the parameter $\epsilon_2$ that relates to $\beta_2$ via the formula \cite{casten2000nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    \epsilon_2\approx=\frac{R_z-R_x}{R_0}=\frac{3}{4}\sqrt{\frac{5}{\pi}}\beta_2=0.946\beta_2\ .
    \label{epsilon-beta-relation}
\end{align}

% \subsection{Nuclear Shapes and Softness}

% A discussion about the implications of the nuclear shapes in terms of some specific phenomena is necessary. Indeed, the shell-model (which will be briefly discussed in the next chapter) considers the motion of the individual nucleons, that are \emph{confined} in nucleonic orbitals, where each nucleon will occupy an orbit with a quantized value of angular momentum. The interpretation of the gamma-ray spectra of different nuclei can be properly described through the excitations if individual nucleons between different orbits, but only for nuclei that are near closed shells. 

% Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about nuclei that lie far from a shell closure, where tools like \emph{Collective Model} - C.M. \cite{bohr1998nuclear} help understand the properties of these nuclei. One can see that any additional nucleon to the closed shells will imply a departure from the spherical view of a nucleus, with deformations along one of the axis of that nucleus. With the help of C.M., the energy spectrum of many nuclei can be understood and described in terms of 1) a rotation around an axis that is perpendicular to the deformation axis, but also in terms of a 2) motion of the nucleus as a whole (i.e., collective behavior) in tandem with one coming from a single nucleon (i.e., single-particle behavior).

% As an example, nuclei in the region $N=82$ were extensively studied, and the properties of a given nuclide are not only determined by the specific orbital occupied by valence nucleons (e.g., proton orbitals such as $s_{1/2}$, $h_{11/2}$ or neutron orbitals such as $f_{7/2}$, $h_{9/2}$), but also the proportion of each shell that is filled with protons and neutrons, respectively. The nuclei in this closed shell $N=82$ region are considered as perfect examples of evolutions from the single-particle motion, and the evolution to a collective behavior can be emphasized around the \emph{midshell} at $N=104$. 

% These midshell nuclei have a deformation that is present along only one axis: \emph{axially symmetric}. Every orbital will cause the nucleus to change its shape towards either a prolate or an oblate one. The change in prolate/oblate type of deformation will depend on the value of the quadrupole moment \cite{lewis2019lifetime}, quantity used to evaluate the so-called Nilsson levels \cite{ragnarsson2005shapes} (a detailed discussion about the Nilsson orbitals will be made in the following chapter), or Nilsson diagrams: single-particle energies as a function of nuclear deformation. The slope of a Nilsson level is related to the expectation value of the quadrupole moment, via the expression \cite{andersson1976nuclear}:
% \begin{align}
%     \frac{d e_k}{d\beta}=-\bra{j}q\ket{j}\, 
% \end{align}
% where $e_k$ represents the energy of the single-particle state $\ket{j}$, $\beta$ is the deformation, and $q$ is the quadrupole operator. Each nucleon that occupies an orbit with a given slope will contribute to an overall deformation: one nucleon that occupies a downward sloping orbital which for positive $\beta$ will drive the nucleus to a prolate shape, while the other type of nucleon that occupies an upward sloping orbital will drive the nucleus to an oblate shape. The competition between these two polarizing effects will result in the axial asymmetry.

% In triaxial nuclei (\emph{axially-asymmetric}), a number of low-lying nuclear configurations can exist, leading to different shapes. When the nucleus has a dynamic degree of triaxiality (via the $\gamma$ deformation parameter), it is said to be a $\gamma$-\emph{soft nucleus}. 

% The $\gamma$-soft nuclei tend to exist when both the protons and neutrons occupy the top and bottom of their shells, respectively. The opposite also holds true \cite{chen2014collective}. The conditions for $\gamma$-soft nuclear deformations are realized, for example, in $N \approx 90$ nuclei, where the Fermi surfaces are located near the top of the proton shell ($h_{11/2}$) and bottom of the neutron shell ($i_{13/2}$).

% It is interesting that a single nucleus does not necessarily holds a single fixed shape. If the potential energy surface (PES) is relatively flat with respect to the triaxiality parameter $\gamma$ (meaning that there is no constrain with regards to the minimum value of $\gamma$), the shape can oscillate within an interval of deformation. Such a feature characterizes the $\gamma$-softness of the nucleus itself.

\section{Nuclear Models}
\label{section-nuclear-models}

In the following section, a discussion will be made about the nuclear models that are used in order to describe phenomena specific to rotating nuclei. Since the focus of this work emerges from a \emph{class} of properties that usually applies to the high-spin region, it makes sense to consider all the theoretical notions that cover the underlying effects.

\subsection{Deformed Shell Model}

A formalism which describes the nuclear properties is the \emph{Shell Model}. It is based on an approximation of the independent motion for a nucleon within an average potential. The potential is generated by the interaction of that nucleon with all the remaining nucleons from the compounding nucleus. It works really well for spherical nuclei and it is a successful tool in reproducing and predicting the properties of nuclear states. The theory also proves to be efficient for excited states having nucleonic configurations that are dominated by a single nucleon or a very small number of `extra' nucleons. However, this version of the Shell Model works well only for magic nuclei, nuclei that have both even number of protons and neutrons, and nuclei whose shapes are not well deformed. In order to give a realistic description of a larger class of nuclei (e.g., deformed, odd $Z$, odd $N$, and so on), the \emph{Deformed Shell-Model} should be employed. This will be described in the following subsection, while a general overview of the concepts regarding the formerly mentioned model is made in Appendix \ref{appendix:shell-model}. Therein, the simple harmonic oscillator, and a modified version that is amended with additional terms are introduced. As it will be shown, these are used to obtain the Hamiltonian for the Deformed Shell Model.

% For nuclei that are even in both the proton number and the neutron number, the nuclear ground-state has a spin and parity that are properly reproduced by the \emph{spherical shell model}: $I^\pi=0^+$. In a nucleus with complete shells, the \emph{net spin} must be zero. On the other hand, a nucleus with one nucleon missing from a complete shell closure, the ground-state spin should be equal to the a.m. value of the orbital occupied by the hole. Moreover, the parity of the ground-state for a given nucleus is determined by the orbital a.m. value $l$:
% \begin{align}
%     \pi=(-)^l\to
%     \begin{cases}
%         +1 &\text{for even-}l\ \text{levels}\\
%         -1 &\text{for odd-}l\ \text{levels}\ .
%     \end{cases}
% \end{align}

% For odd-odd nuclei, one can find the ground-state (g.s.) spin and parity via the last two valence nucleons \cite{krane1991introductory,bertulani2007nuclear}. The coupling rules that are allowed in the odd-odd nuclei were determined more than 50 years ago by Gallagher et al. \cite{gallagher1958coupling}:
% \begin{align}
%     I&=j_p+j_n\ \text{if}\ j_p=l_p\pm\frac{1}{2}\ \text{and}\ j_n=l_n\pm\frac{1}{2}\ ,\\
%     I&=|j_p-j_n|\ \text{if}\ j_p=l_p\pm\frac{1}{2}\ \text{and}\ j_n=l_n\mp\frac{1}{2}\ .
% \end{align}

\subsection{Deformed Shell Model - Nilsson Model}
\label{nilsson-model-section}

The idea that some nuclei are deformed in their ground-state was enforced experimentally a long time ago, when measuring quantities such as density distributions or nuclear quadrupole moments \cite{casten2000nuclear}. The non-spherical shapes are given by the existence of nucleonic configurations, which lie away from the major shell closure. In Section \ref{theoretical-aspects} from this chapter, the description of the nuclear shapes was treated using the well-known formula of the nuclear radius given in terms of the collective coordinates (see Eq. \ref{nuclear-shape}), resulting in the \emph{spherical}, \emph{axially-symmetric}, and \emph{axially-asymmetric} nuclear shapes.

Developed by Nilsson in 1955 \cite{nilsson1955binding} for treating the \emph{deformed nuclei}, it is a modified shell model with deformations taken into account by the use of the \emph{anisotropic harmonic oscillator} (AHO) (see Appendix \ref{appendix:shell-model} for the simple and modified ones). Similarly as for the basic shell model, the goal is to obtain an expression for the single-particle energies of a nucleon. The basic Hamiltonian corresponding to this kind of system is shown below \cite{bertulani2007nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    H=H_0+a_1\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}+a_2l^2\ ,
    \label{nilsson-simple-hamiltonian}
\end{align}
where $H_0$ is the AHO term. The general expression for this kind of oscillator is:
\begin{align}
    H_\text{AHO}\equiv H_0=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+\frac{1}{2}m(\omega_x^2x^2+\omega_y^2y^2+\omega_z^2z^2)\ .
\end{align}

In the expression of the single-particle Hamiltonian, the constants $a_1$ and $a_2$ are usually determined via adjustments to the experimental results. It can be seen that both the centrifugal-like term $l^2$, which simulates a flattening of the oscillator potential, and the $\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}$ term are also present here, as it was the case for the spherical shell model. However, the explicit form of Eq. \ref{nilsson-simple-hamiltonian} is as follows:
\begin{align}
    H_\text{Nil}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2+&\frac{1}{2}m(\omega_x^2x^2+\omega_y^2y^2+\omega_z^2z^2)-2\kappa\hbar\omega_0(\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s})\nonumber\\&-2\kappa\hbar\omega_0\mu\left(l^2-\langle l^2\rangle_N\right)\ .
    \label{eq-full-nilsson-ham}
\end{align}

The parameters $\kappa$ and $\mu$ act as strength parameters for the spin-orbit coupling term and the centrifugal term, respectively. The last term is a correction, which was introduced by Gustafson et al. \cite{gustafson1967nuclear}.
%The last term is a correction, which was originally considered as $\mu l^2$, but it was pointed by Gustafson et al. \cite{gustafson1967nuclear} that the shift in energy is way too large for big values of $N$ (principal quantum number). As a result, taking the current expression for the correction term helps to compensate.
The three \emph{oscillator frequencies} are chosen to be inversely proportional to the semi-axis lengths of the deformed ellipsoid (denoted by $a_x$, $a_y$, and $a_z$) such that:
\begin{align}
    \omega_r=\omega_0\frac{R_0}{a_r}\ ,\ r=x,y,z\ .
\end{align}

For the spherical case, the oscillator frequency $\hbar\omega_0$ is set to $41A^{-1/3}$ MeV (calculation for this value arise from the shell model with SHO \cite{bertulani2007nuclear}). For the axially-symmetric case, one can choose the $z$-axis as symmetry axis, implying that the oscillator frequencies along the $x$ and $y$ axes are equivalent (that is $\omega_x=\omega_y\equiv\omega_\perp$). Following the calculations done in \cite{bertulani2007nuclear}, one can express the two relevant oscillator frequencies in terms of a deformation parameter $\epsilon_2$ (whose dependence on the quadrupole deformation parameter $\beta_2$ has been shown in Eq. \ref{epsilon-beta-relation}) as such:
\begin{align}
    \omega_\perp^2=\omega_0^2\left(1+\frac{2}{3}\epsilon_2\right)\ ,\\
    \omega_z^2=\omega_0^2\left(1-\frac{4}{3}\epsilon_2\right)\ .
    \label{oscillator-frequencies-nilsson}
\end{align}

Moreover, a dependence on the deformation parameter itself is employed for the frequency $\omega_0$ that appears in the expressions for $\omega_\perp$ and $\omega_z$, respectively:
\begin{align}
    \omega_0=\left(1-\frac{4}{3}\epsilon_2^2-\frac{16}{27}\epsilon_2^3\right)^{-1/6}\ ,
    \label{omega-0-oscillator-frequency}
\end{align}
where $\bar{\omega}_0$ can be considered a constant written as $\bar{\omega}_0=(\omega_x\omega_y\omega_z)^{1/3}=\text{const}$. This is coming from the harmonic oscillator at zero deformation and by considering the conservation of the nuclear volume. The energy eigenvalue $\varepsilon_q$ for the nucleonic state $\psi_q$ belonging to a deformed nucleus can be determined by solving the Schrödinger equation associated to each nucleon in particular:
\begin{align}
    H_\text{Nil}\psi_q=\varepsilon_q\psi_q\ ,
    \label{nilsson-schrodiner-equation}
\end{align}
where the index $q$ denotes a set with all the relevant quantum numbers. This set is also called the \emph{asymptotic quantum numbers}, which are used to specify a \emph{Nilsson orbital}. The well-known notation is as follows (still considering the $z$-axis as the symmetry axis):
\begin{align}
    \Omega^\pi\left[Nn_z\Lambda\right]\ .
    \label{nilsson-notation}
\end{align}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Lambda$ is the projection of the particle's orbital a.m. along the symmetry axis (component of $l$ along $z$)
    \item $N$ the principal quantum number of the major shell. It also determines the parity as $\pi=(-1)^N$, making the notation from Eq. \ref{nilsson-notation} somewhat redundant
    \item $n_z$ is the number of oscillator quanta along the symmetry axis. More precisely, it gives the number of nodes for the wave-function along the direction of the $z$-axis
    \item $\Omega$ is the projection of the particle's total a.m. along the symmetry axis (i.e., $\mathbf{j}$). Moreover, the projection of the intrinsic spin of a nucleon onto the symmetry axis can have the values $\Sigma=\pm\frac{1}{2}$, so that $\Omega=\Lambda+\Sigma=\pm\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{itemize}

Fig. \ref{fig-nilsson-quantum-numbers} shows the geometrical meaning of the asymptotic quantum numbers for the Nilsson model. Indeed, for a single nucleon orbiting a deformed core, the vector $\mathbf{R}$ represents the angular momentum of a \emph{rotating nucleus}, the vector $\mathbf{I}$ represents the total a.m. of the entire nucleus, $\mathbf{j}$ is the total a.m. of the single-particle (that is $\mathbf{j}=\mathbf{l}+\mathbf{s}$). However, two more quantum numbers should be mentioned: the projection of the total a.m. $\mathbf{I}$ onto the symmetry axis, denoted by $K$, and the projection of the same vector onto the laboratory axis, referred to as $M$.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/nilsson_quantum_numbers.pdf}
    \caption{Geometrical interpretation of the Nilsson's asymptotic quantum numbers. This figure is inspired from Ref. \cite{garnsworthy2007neutron}}
    \label{fig-nilsson-quantum-numbers}
\end{figure}

Regarding the quantum numbers sketched in Fig. \ref{fig-nilsson-quantum-numbers}, there is an important aspect which needs to be specified about the projections $K$ and $\Omega$, respectively. Indeed, it is clear that compared to the spherical case, where different orientations are irrelevant to the energy spectrum of nucleons, in the deformed case different directions in space lead to different energies. The orientation is in fact specified by the \emph{magnetic sub-state} of the nucleon, i.e., the projection of the total angular momentum on the symmetry axis. This projections is denoted by $\Omega$ for the single-particle, however, because the rotational angular momentum $\mathbf{R}$ in the axially deformed is perpendicular to the symmetry axis for low-lying states, then it will have no contribution to $K$, meaning that one can use $\Omega$ and $K$ interchangeably.

\subsection{Single-particle states in deformed nuclei}

It is instructive to go into detail about the quantum numbers defined in Eq. \ref{nilsson-notation}, since the orbits characterizing the nucleons point out the nature of deformations that take place. The quantum numbers $N$, $n_z$, and $\Lambda$ are good quantum numbers only when the nuclear deformation is large, meaning that $\epsilon$ (or equivalently $\beta$) tends to infinity. In fact, this is the main reason why they are called asymptotic quantum numbers. However, the numbers $\Omega$ and $\pi$ remain good quantum numbers even for low and moderate deformations for the nucleus. It should be noted that if $N$ is even, then $(\Lambda+n_z)$ is also even. Similarly, if $N$ is odd, then the sum of the other two quantum numbers must also be odd \cite{casten2000nuclear}.

Since the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H_\text{Nil}$ ultimately depend on the deformation parameter $\epsilon$, each nucleon will have an orbit (energy) that is deformation dependent. At zero deformation all the energy levels for a single-particle state will have a $2j+1$ degeneracy. This translates to the fact that all $2j+1$ possible orientations of $\vec{j}$ are equivalent. On the other side, when the potential is deformed, this will no longer hold, i.e., the energy levels in the deformed potential will depend on the spatial orientation of the orbit itself.

As an example, a nucleon from the $f_{7/2}$ shell will be considered. This nucleon can have eight possible components in the range $\Omega=[-\frac{7}{2},\frac{7}{2}]$. Because of the reflection symmetry, the positive components of $\Omega$ will have the same energy as the negative ones, leading to a degeneracy of the levels. Additionally, the single-particle $f_{7/2}$ state will split up into four new states when deformation emerges: $\Omega=\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2},\frac{5}{2},\frac{7}{2}$ (all of negative parity). In Figs. \ref{nillson-orbits-prolate-projections} - \ref{nillson-orbits-oblate-projections} the different orbits of the odd particle are given for both prolate and oblate deformations.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{Chapters/Figures/nillson_SP_orbits.pdf}
    \caption{A simple sketch showing the single-particle orbits for the $j=7/2$ nucleonic state, along the symmetry axis for a \emph{prolate} deformation. The actual projections are $\Omega_1=\frac{1}{2}$, $\Omega_2=\frac{3}{2}$, $\Omega_3=\frac{5}{2}$, and $\Omega_4=\frac{7}{2}$. The figure was inspired from Ref. \cite{krane1991introductory}.}
    \label{nillson-orbits-prolate-projections}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{Chapters/Figures/nillson_SP_orbits_2.pdf}
    \caption{A simple sketch showing the single-particle orbits for the $j=7/2$ nucleonic state, along the symmetry axis for an \emph{oblate} deformation. The actual projections are $\Omega_1=\frac{1}{2}$, $\Omega_2=\frac{3}{2}$, $\Omega_3=\frac{5}{2}$, and $\Omega_4=\frac{7}{2}$. The figure was inspired from Ref. \cite{krane1991introductory}.}
    \label{nillson-orbits-oblate-projections}
\end{figure}

From Figs. \ref{nillson-orbits-prolate-projections} - \ref{nillson-orbits-oblate-projections}, it can be seen that the first orbit (denoted by orbit $1$) lies closest to the core in the prolate case, while in the oblate case this is true for orbit $4$. This will influence the interaction strength, meaning that for the prolate case, the orbit $1$ will interact the strongest with the \emph{core}, while in the oblate case, it is the orbit $4$ having the strongest interaction with the bulk core. Moreover, the strength of interaction indicates the magnitude of the energies for each projection: the stronger the interaction between the orbit and the core, the more tightly bound and lower in energy these states are. For prolate deformations, the orbits with the smallest $\Omega$ `prefer' to lie lower in energy (interacting strongly with the core). For oblate deformations, the opposite is true: orbits with the maximal $\Omega$ interact the strongest with the core and, therefore, lie lowest in energy.

Another way of looking at the coupling of the single-particle with the bulk core can be given in terms of overlaps of their corresponding wave-functions (eigenstates). Indeed, a nucleon lying in the lowest $\Omega$ orbit will have a \emph{maximum} wave-function overlap with a prolate core. On the other hand, nucleons lying in the highest $\Omega$ orbits will have maximum overlap with the oblate core. The overlap gives the overall binding energy between the two systems (i.e., core and particle) as explained in the previous paragraph. Discussion about the wave-function overlap and the nuclear density distribution \cite{frauendorf2014transverse, das2018nuclear} will be made in the following chapters. The induced degeneracy due to deformation for a particle state $l_j$ is shown in Fig. \ref{nillson-orbits-splittings}, for $f_{7/2}$.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/nillson_SP_splittings.pdf}
    \caption{The effect of deformation for the particle state $f_{7/2}$. It can be seen that indeed, as it was mentioned within the text, $\Omega_1$ component lies lowest in energy for the oblate deformation, and $\Omega_4$ component lies the lowest in energy for an oblate deformation.}
    \label{nillson-orbits-splittings}
\end{figure}

Obviously, the sketch shown in Fig. \ref{nillson-orbits-splittings} is just an instructive example and it does not represent an accurate description of the single-particle energies for deformed nuclei. In fact, if the potential is deformed, the quantum numbers $l$ and $j$ are not valid anymore (a.m. is no longer a constant of motion for non-spherical potentials). A proper description of the single-particle orbits is represented by the so-called \emph{Nilsson diagrams}, where the energy for each state is represented as a function of the deformation parameter. Remember that the energies are in fact the eigenvalues of the Schrödinger equation associated with the initial Nilsson deformed Hamiltonian (see Eq. \ref{nilsson-schrodiner-equation}). Diagrams that show such spectra are represented in Figs. \ref{nillson-diagram} - \ref{nillson-diagram-2}. It can be seen that each state within a Nilsson diagram is represented as a solid line or a dashed line, depending on its parity (remember that the parity quantum number is given by $(-1)^N$ or, equivalently, by $(-1)^l$). The orbital labelling from the Figs. \ref{nillson-diagram} - \ref{nillson-diagram-2} is consistent with the one defined in the previous subsection. Another important aspect which can be seen in the Nilsson diagrams (for some orbits) is the `crossing' between states with different quantum numbers. More insight into the geometrical interpretation of the Nilsson orbitals is provided in Section \ref{appendix:extra-nilsson-orbitals} from Appendix \ref{appendix:shell-model}.

% The spectrum of one-particle orbits plays an invaluable role within the nuclear structure and the study of deformations: the picture of one-particle motion in deformed potentials works much better than the case of single-particle motion in spherical potentials for spherically shaped nuclei. Multiple quantitative analyses have been performed on experimental data of well-deformed (especially odd-$A$) nuclei, from light ($^{25}$Mg, $^{25}$Al) to heavy ($^{169}$Tm, $^{175}$Yb, $^{177}$Yb) \cite{hamamoto2016interplay}.

\subsection{Collective Model}

Although the previous single-particle model is able to successfully treat many nuclei, the single-nucleon motion in a deformed potential is not enough to describe phenomena such as nuclear fission or quantities like quadrupole moments of deformed nuclei \cite{townes1949nuclear}. Moreover, lifetime measurements through single-particle calculations fail to reproduce experimental data on some gamma-ray transitions of quadrupole nature \cite{goldhaber1951classification}.

The collective model is one of the most `complete' tools in describing the nuclear phenomena across the chart of nuclides. It brought tremendous progress within the nuclear community by validating and predicting the nuclear behavior at different spin ranges. A major feature of this model is the introduction of the so-called \emph{rotational bands}. Developed by Bohr and Mottelson \cite{bohr1953collective,bohr1998nuclear} more than 50 years ago, the Nuclear Collective Model is based on the Liquid-Drop-Model \cite{meitner1939disintegration,bohr1939mechanism,myers1974nuclear}. Moreover, the predictions for nuclear deformation made by Rainwater \cite{rainwater1950nuclear} played another fundamental role. The basic assumption is that the nuclear density distribution can be approximated as a droplet with shape-specific degrees of freedom. This droplet is also vibrating and rotating. According to the discussion from Section \ref{nuclear-shapes}, the nuclear radius was described in terms of a set of \emph{collective coordinates}, which dictate the shape evolution with time.

\subsection{Bohr Hamiltonian}
\label{bohr-hamiltonian}
As a first step, the concept of a nuclear liquid drop is used to construct the Hamiltonian. The droplet exhibits shape and surface oscillations, which have a dynamical character. These shape oscillations are illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig-nuclear-vibration}, where a vibrating nucleus is represented, having a spherical \emph{equilibrium} shape. Since the collective coordinates are time-dependent, at each moment in time, the nuclear radius $R$ will be defined in the direction given by the radial coordinates $\theta,\varphi$. By using Eq. \ref{nuclear-shape} that characterizes the \emph{vibrations} of a nuclear surface, one can give the Hamiltonian of \emph{collective} nature as \cite{ring2004nuclear,bertulani2007nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    H_\text{coll}\equiv T+V=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\lambda\mu}\left[B_\lambda\left|\frac{\text{d}\alpha_{\lambda\mu}}{\text{d}t}\right|^2+C_\lambda|\alpha_{\lambda\mu}|^2\right]\ .
    \label{collective-hamiltonian-stiffness-inertia}
\end{align}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/shape_oscillations.pdf}
    \caption{The vibration of a nucleus whose equilibrium shape is a spheroid, with nuclear radius $R_0$ (\emph{average nuclear radius}) and the nuclear radius $R$ at a different moment in time. The equilibrium shape is represented by the red color, while the surface vibration is represented by the blue color. The oscillations are depicted through the double arrows.}
    \label{fig-nuclear-vibration}
\end{figure}

The Hamiltonian is invariant under rotations and also invariant under time reversal \cite{messiah2014quantum}. The real numbers $B_\lambda$ and $C_\lambda$ represent the \emph{inertial} and \emph{stiffness} parameters. Choosing the body-fixed axis as a reference system will simplify the results, since the system's axes coincide with the principal axes of the ellipsoid itself. Assuming this coordinate system and an axial ellipsoid, the kinetic term from $H_\text{coll}$ can be decomposed into a \emph{rotational} and a \emph{vibrational} part, i.e., $T=T_\text{vib}+T_\text{rot}$. Their expressions are given in terms of the deformation parameters $(\beta,\gamma)$, the mass parameters $B_2$ (for the quadrupole deformations) and the stiffness parameters $C_2$. Thus, the vibrational term is \cite{li2022model}:
\begin{align}
    T_\text{vib}=\frac{1}{2}B_2\left(\dot{\beta}^2+\beta^2\dot{\gamma}^2\right)\ ,
    \label{kinetic-vibrational-energy-collective}
\end{align}
and the rotational term is \cite{li2022model}:
\begin{align}
    T_\text{rot}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_i^3\mathcal{I}_i\omega_i^2\ ,
    \label{kinetic-rotational-energy-collective}
\end{align}
where the three principal axes of the ellipsoid are indexed by $i=1,2,3$. In the expression of $T_\text{rot}$, two crucial physical quantities arise, namely the angular velocities around each body-fixed axis and the functions $\mathcal{I}_k$ that will eventually play the role of \emph{moments of inertia}. 

There are two types of moments of inertia that describe the nuclear rotation: the rigid-like MOI and the irrotational (hydrodynamical) MOI, having the following expressions \cite{bohr1954rotational,ring2004nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{I}_k^\text{rig}&=\frac{2}{5}mAR_0^2\left(1-\sqrt{\frac{5}{4\pi}\beta\cos\left(\gamma-\frac{2\pi}{3}k\right)}\right)\ ,\\
    \mathcal{I}_k^\text{irr}&=\frac{3}{2\pi}mAR_0^2\beta^2\sin^2\left(\gamma-\frac{2\pi}{3}k\right)\ .
    \label{eq-irrotational-rigid-mois}
\end{align}

The dependence of the two types of MOI on the triaxiality parameter $\gamma$ (and fixed $\beta$) can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig-irrotational-rigid-mois}. The differences between the rigid and irrotational MOI are as follow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The irrotational MOI vanish when the ellipsoid has axial symmetry
    \item $\mathcal{I}^\text{irr}$ is much more sensitive to the deformation $\beta$, while the rigid MOI have most of the contribution coming from a typical rigid sphere
    \item The \emph{experimental} MOI of well-deformed nuclei show that the \emph{real} MOI within a nucleus are neither irrotational, nor rigid-like, but in fact they follow:
    \begin{align}
        \mathcal{I}^\text{irr}<\mathcal{I}^\text{exp}<\mathcal{I}^\text{rig}\ ,
        \label{experimental-MOI-vs-rig-irr}
    \end{align}
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/mois_rig_irr.pdf}
    \caption{Comparison between the rigid-like and irrotational-like MOI defined in Eq. \ref{eq-irrotational-rigid-mois}, which are typical for a rigid rotator or an irrotational motion of a fluid. The deformation parameter $\beta$ is fixed $\beta=0.3$.}
    \label{fig-irrotational-rigid-mois}
\end{figure}

In the following two subsections, each type of degree of freedom will be described, giving the main characteristics of the energy spectra associated with the two motions. 

\subsection{Nuclear Vibration}

The energy spectrum is composed of levels built from the oscillator frequencies. The absorption or emission of vibration-like energy quanta (i.e., phonons) when the nucleus transitions to a higher or a lower energy state will be in terms of dipole, quadrupole, octupole, etc. vibrating phonons. These excitations will generate the ground and excited states, resulting in a `collection' of \emph{vibrational bands}. Since the quadrupole effects are of interest within the current work, a spectrum specific to quadrupole vibrations $\lambda=2$ phonons can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig-vibrational-bands}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/vibrational_states.pdf}
    \caption{Illustration of vibrational bands built as excitations of multiple phonons on a ground state. The left side reflects an ideal harmonic vibrator, with the degenerate spin states indicated for each level. Right side shows non-degenerate vibrational levels that exist in nuclei. Keep in mind that each phonon level is built as multiple excitations of a \emph{quadrupole phonon}.}
    \label{fig-vibrational-bands}
\end{figure}

% A general rule that is used to construct vibrational bands is related to the concept of \emph{symmetrized states}. Since the excited quanta are represented by phonons (identical bosons) having integer angular momentum (e.g., $\lambda=2$ for the quadrupole vibrations), the only spin states than can be observed in such spectra are the ones for which the final angular momenta couple to give symmetric combinations. This is the reason why in the energy state created by exciting the ground state $0^+$ with two phonons, only the states $0^+,2^+,4^+$ appear; the spin states $1^+$ and $3^+$ do not give symmetric combinations. A more generic method for determining which sequence of spins can be obtained by coupling angular momenta of vibrational phonons can be seen in Ref. \cite{ring2004nuclear}.

A quantity often used within the measurements of nuclear properties is the ratio between the second and the first excited states within a band. These ratios are usually denoted by $E(4^+)/E(2^+)$ (the state $4^+$ belongs to the triplet phonon state depicted in Fig. \ref{fig-vibrational-bands}), and the theoretical value for the vibrational model gives a value of $2$. However, some experimental results point out to a value close to $2.2$ for nuclei below $A=150$, and a constant value of $3.3$ for $150<A<190$ (refer to Fig. \ref{4state-2state-ratio}). It should be noted that for the latter case, the value of the ratio is specific to another kind of nucleonic motion: \emph{rotation}, which will be discussed in the following section.
Example of experimental \emph{vibrational bands} for several even-$A$ nuclei are shown in Fig. \ref{energy-levels-120Te-virbational-band}.

    \label{energy-levels-120Te-virbational-band}    
\end{figure}

There can also be vibrational bands in odd-$A$ nuclei. Indeed, if one considers the nucleus as a spherical even-even core plus an extra nucleon, the \emph{final} nuclear states are formed by coupling an individual $j$ orbit with the vibrational states of the core. An example is $^{63}$Cu, which has the ground state $3/2^{-}$. The g.s. for this nucleus is given by the last \emph{uncoupled} nucleon that occupies a shell. In fact, for this particular nucleus, it is the $2p_{3/2}$ proton that will give the final spin and parity of the nucleus. The vibrational spectrum is regarded as coupling the aforementioned proton with the $^{62}$Ni core. Indeed, by taking a $2^+$ vibrational phonon from the even-$A$ nucleus, then the (odd-proton + phonon) system can generate a sequence of energy states with angular momenta $I=1/2,\ 3/2,\ 5/2,\ 7/2$ and negative parity states. The energy levels depicted in Fig. \ref{energy-levels-63Cu-virbational-band} show the particle-core coupling effects on the vibrational structure in odd-mass nuclei.

The blue rectangle tries to emphasize that the quadruplet in $^{63}$Cu is formed by the coupling of the odd proton to the $2^+$ vibrational state from the neighboring nucleus.}
    \label{energy-levels-63Cu-virbational-band}
\end{figure}

Since the quadrupole vibrations carry an angular momentum of $\lambda=2$, there can be two types of vibrations in a deformed nucleus: one corresponding to $K=0$ and one for $K=2$. The $K=0$ vibrational motion is called $\beta$-vibration, and this induces a small fluctuations in the quadrupole deformation parameter, but it preserves the axial symmetry of the nucleus (the vibration is aligned with the deformation axis). The $K=2$ vibration is called the $\gamma$-vibration, which is responsible for fluctuations in the triaxiality parameter $\gamma$. A qualitative description for such an oscillation can be explained in terms of an american football \cite{krane1991introductory}: $\gamma$-vibrations consist of a simultaneous pushing and pulling of the ball on its sides, while the $\beta$ vibrations correspond to continuous pushing and pulling on the ends of the football. An illustration explaining the geometrical meaning of the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ vibrations in nuclei can be seen in Fig. \ref{rotation-vibration-geometrics}.

    \caption{The $\beta$ and $\gamma$ vibrations occurring in nuclei. The initial nucleus in this example is of prolate type. Each mode of vibration is visualized from the side-view and top-view, respectively. This figure was inspired from Ref. \cite{li2022model}.}
    \label{rotation-vibration-geometrics}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Nuclear Rotation}

The rotational-kinetic term from $H_\text{coll}$ is called the \emph{rotational energy}, and its expression is given by \cite{corrigan1976exact}:
\begin{align}
    \hat{T}_\text{rot}=\frac{\hat{I}_1^2}{2\mathcal{I}_1}+\frac{\hat{I}_2^2}{2\mathcal{I}_2}+\frac{\hat{I}_3^2}{2\mathcal{I}_3}\ .
    \label{eq-rotational-energy-quantized}
\end{align}

The three operators that appear in Eq. \ref{eq-rotational-energy-quantized} are the projections of the total angular momentum $\mathbf{I}$ on the body-fixed axes (see Fig. \ref{rotational-coupling-schematic} for reference). Note that throughout the text, the angular momentum will be interchangeably represented with an arrow or by bold letters.

An important conclusion emerging from the work of Bohr and Mottelson \cite{bohr1954rotational} (also see discussion in Ref. \cite{greiner1996nuclear}) is that no rotations about the symmetry axis are possible for spherical nuclei or axially deformed nuclei. 
%Consequently, a prior deformation (e.g., of quadrupole type) and a rotating axis which does not coincide with the symmetry one are required for the appearance of rotational levels.
Indeed, every nucleus which contains energy states that are generated by the rotational motion has these bands due to the rotation about an axis that is different from the symmetry axis, and its shape is either axially-symmetric or axially-asymmetric \cite{hamamoto2016interplay}. In its motion, a nucleus can generate angular momentum in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{collectively}: via combined rotations and vibrations of the nuclear droplet (the rotation + vibration spectrum of a nucleus will be shown in the next section)
    \item \emph{single-particle excitations}: unpaired nucleons can rearrange themselves in such a way that they account to the nuclear spin
\end{itemize}

The coupling of the droplet's rotational a.m. $\mathbf{R}$ with the single-particle angular momentum of a valence nucleon $\mathbf{j}$ can be seen in Fig. \ref{rotational-coupling-schematic}. Based on the expression of $T_\text{rot}$ from Eq. \ref{kinetic-rotational-energy-collective}, its quantized form given in Eq. \ref{eq-rotational-energy-quantized}, and the coupling scheme depicted in Fig. \ref{rotational-coupling-schematic}, it is possible to construct a Hamiltonian that corresponds to rotating nucleus with no valence particle. More precisely, the $\mathbf{j}$ term is neglected, such that only the pure collective motion of a nucleus is emphasized ($\mathbf{I}=\mathbf{R}$). The energy spectrum for an even-even nucleus is thus expressed as \cite{davydov1958rotational}:
% This approximation is however only valid for even-even nuclei and for the low-lying states \cite{bertulani2007nuclear,davydov1958rotational}:
% \begin{align}
%     H&=H_\text{rot}+H_\text{intr}=\sum_i\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mathcal{I}_i}R_i^2\ ,
% \end{align}
% where the second term $H_\text{intr}$ represents some effects coming from the internal structure of the rotator itself. However, most of the time these terms can be neglected, leading to a rather simple energy spectrum for the even-even nuclei:
\begin{align}
    E_\text{rot}(I)=\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mathcal{I}_\perp}I(I+1)\ .
    \label{eq-simple-rotor-spectrum}
\end{align}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Chapters/Figures/SCHEMATIC_COUPLING_ROTATIONAL.pdf}
    \caption{The coupling of the collective angular momentum with the angular momentum of a single-particle for an axially deformed nucleus that is rotating about an axis perpendicular to the deformation axis.}
    \label{rotational-coupling-schematic}
\end{figure}

In the above expression, $\mathcal{I}_\perp$ corresponds to an axis that is perpendicular to the symmetry axis (i.e., either $1$-axis or the $2$-axis) of the ellipsoid. In the case of axial symmetry both moments are equivalent, such that the general notation $\mathcal{I}_\perp$ is made. As an observation, since there is no single-particle contribution, the quantized angular momentum $I$ is equivalent to $R$. The spectrum defined by Eq. \ref{eq-simple-rotor-spectrum} leads to energy spacings $\propto I(I+1)$, which is also met in the molecular spectra. The ground-state will always be the state $0^+$, and due to the \emph{mirror symmetry} that is required for the wave-functions describing the even-even nuclei, every other excited state will be represented by an even value of the spin: $2^+,4^+,\dots$ \cite{ring2004nuclear}. The ratio $E(4^+)/E(2^+)$ for these bands is $3.33$. This is indeed the best signature for the rotational phenomena in nuclei, indicating a clear presence of deformation + rotational motion. In a previous work by the current team (Raduta et al. \cite{raduta2017semiclassical}), some spectra of even-even $^{158}$Er were studied, and agreement with the observed experimental data was impressive. The energy spectra obtained from Eq. \ref{eq-simple-rotor-spectrum} has a classical counterpart known within literature as the \emph{symmetric top}. Fig \ref{rotational-bands-even-even} shows some examples of rotational bands in even-$A$ nuclei.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Chapters/Figures/Er158-Rotational-Bands.pdf}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Chapters/Figures/Hf180-Rotational-Bands.pdf}
    \caption{Experimental data showing the rotational bands in even-even nuclei. Note the spacing between the states that increases with $I$ via the rule from Eq. \ref{eq-simple-rotor-spectrum}. Experimental data are taken from Refs. \cite{nica2017nuclear,mccutchan2015nuclear}.}
    \label{rotational-bands-even-even}
\end{figure}

The spectra of a simple rigid rotator assumes that the projection $K$ of the total angular momentum for the ground-state of even-even nuclei is $K=0$. So the next step is to consider more general cases of nuclear rotation. There are two general cases of rotational bands that can occur, and both require the coupling scheme of a rotor with a valence nucleon, such that the angular momentum will be $\mathbf{I}=\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{j}$ (so both situations will correspond to odd-$A$ nuclei). The two situations are called \emph{Deformation aligned bands} and \emph{Rotation aligned bands} \cite{uwitonze2015assignment}. These are detailed in Appendix \ref{appendix:ral-dal-signature-scheme}.

\subsection{Superimposed Rotations and Vibrations}

Up until now, the collective rotations and vibrations were discussed separately. The small vibrations of the nuclear surface lead to band structures constructed via the quadrupole phonons carrying $\lambda=2$ units of angular momentum. The proper picture of a rotating deformed nucleus consists of a stable \emph{equilibrium shape} that is determined by $i)$ the \emph{rapid internal motion of the nucleons} within the nuclear potential and $ii)$ their entire distribution doing a \emph{slow rotation} having a negligible effect on the nuclear structure or on the individual nucleonic orbits.

Besides the two (separated) degrees of freedom for the nuclear system (i.e., collective rotation and vibrations), they can also be superimposed on each other. Starting from the expression of the \emph{Collective Bohr's Hamiltonian}, the spectrum can be described by the general Hamiltonian:
\begin{align}
    H_\text{coll}=T+V=T_\text{vib}+T_\text{rot}+V
\end{align}

A separation of the Hamiltonian terms in three main components will be made: one associated to the $\beta$-vibration, one for $\gamma$-vibrational mode, and the third term is the rotation of a rigid rotor characterized by a total spin $I$ and well-defined MOI. Following the separation, the spectrum will be \cite{ring2004nuclear,li2022model}:
\begin{align}
    E_{n_\beta n_\gamma IK}=\hbar\omega_\beta\left(n_\beta+\frac{1}{2}\right)+\hbar\omega_\gamma\left(n'_\gamma+\frac{1}{2}|K|\right)+\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mathcal{I}}\left[I(I+1)-K^2\right]\ .
    \label{collective-rotation-vibration-energy-spectrum}
\end{align}

Note the two harmonic-like solutions that make the vibrational mode present in the energy formula. The two `frequencies' are given in terms of the stiffness and inertia parameters.
\begin{align}
\omega_\beta=\sqrt{\frac{C_0}{B_2}}\ ,\ \omega_\gamma=\sqrt{\frac{C_2}{B_2}}\ ,   
\end{align}
and the two quantum numbers are as follows \cite{li2022model}: 
\begin{align}
    n_\beta&=0,1,\dots\ ,\\
    n'_\gamma&=2n_\gamma+1\ ,\ n_\gamma=0,1,\dots\ .
\end{align}
The allowed values for the quantum numbers are as \cite{li2022model}:
\begin{align}
    K&=0,2,4,\dots\ ,\nonumber\\
    I&=\begin{cases}
        K,K+1,K+2,\dots &\text{for} K\neq 0\\
        0,2,4,\dots &\text{for} K=0\\
    \end{cases}\ .
\end{align}

Consequently, the spectrum of a typical nucleus in which both vibration and rotation occur has a set of bands that are characterized by the quantum numbers $K,n_\beta,n_\gamma$. This collective spectrum is exemplified in Fig. \ref{collective-rotation-vibration-energy-levels}, and the main bands are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the ground-state band, having states with even $I$, where excitation energies are constructed from the rotor term
    \item the $\beta$ band, starting above the g.s. band with $\hbar\omega_\beta$ and containing only even spins
    \item the $\gamma$ band, corresponding to $K=2$ (as explained in a previous section). It is distinguished from the $\beta$ band because it starts with $2^+$ as first state and it contains both odd and even spins.
    \item the higher-level bands are the $n_\gamma=1$ and $K=4$ bands for $\gamma$-vibrational mode, and the $\beta$ band with $n_\beta=2$.
\end{enumerate}

    \label{collective-rotation-vibration-energy-levels}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Collective Quantities}
\label{c3-collective-quantities}

In this section, some important quantities that are strictly related to the collective nature of nuclei will be described. Indeed, one can understand nuclear deformation, energy spectra, and behavior of nuclei with respect to spin by studying quantities such as \emph{rotational frequencies}, \emph{moments of inertia}, \emph{quadrupole moments}, and so on. The comparison with experimental data for these quantities can help validate the theoretical assertions that are initially made, which represents a crucial test of any model.

\subsubsection{R - Energy Ratio}

As discussed before, the energy ratio between the first excited $4^+$ state to the first excited $2^+$ state is a very good test of rotational or vibrational spectra of nuclei. The evolution of this ratio across the mass number $A$ and a classification between \emph{vibrational} vs. \emph{rotational} character is made in Fig. \ref{4state-2state-ratio}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/vibrations_rotations_E42-ratio.pdf}
    \caption{The experimental ratio $R_{4^+/2^+}$ in even-$Z$ and even-$N$ nuclei. Each line is connecting sequences of isotopes. Note the two important values for $R_{4^+/2^+}$, namely $2$ and $3.33$ given for a perfect vibrator and a pure rotator, respectively. Text with magenta color marks the magic numbers for $Z$ or $N$. This plot was inspired from Ref. \cite{casten2000nuclear}.}
    \label{4state-2state-ratio}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Rotational Frequencies}

In the classical limit the angular frequency:
\begin{align}
    \omega=l_\text{cls.}/\mathcal{I}\ ,
\end{align}
describes the kinetic energy of a rotating object. Indeed, $\omega$ is frequency of rotation around a particular direction, and its quadratic behavior gives the energy:
\begin{align}
    E=\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{I}\omega^2\ ,
\end{align}

The above expression can also be given in terms of the angular momentum $l_\text{cls.}$, such that the final energy becomes $E_\text{cls.}=l_\text{cls.}^2/(2\mathcal{I})$. Quantum mechanically, it was shown that $l^2$ is expressed as $\hat{l}^2_\text{quantum}=\hbar^2 l(l+1)$. Bengtsson et al. \cite{bengtsson1979quasiparticle} calculated the so-called \emph{Routhians} (single-particle energies within the rotating frame of reference), and they found a \emph {canonical} relation between the energies and rotational frequencies:
\begin{align}
    \omega=\frac{\text{d}E(I)}{\text{d}I_x}\ ,
    \label{rotational-frequency-canonical-definition}
\end{align}
where the term $I_x$ is called the \emph{aligned angular momentum}, and it usually denotes the experimental spin of every state minus a reference value \cite{harris1965higher}. The signature property discussed in Appendix \ref{appendix:ral-dal-signature-scheme} plays a pivotal role in determining $I_x(I)$, since the projection $K$ of the angular momentum onto the deformation axis must be taken into account:
\begin{align}
    I_x(I)=\sqrt{\left(I+\frac{1}{2}\right)^2-K^2}\ ,
    \label{aligned-angular-momentum}
\end{align}

In the case of $K=0$ bands, the aligned angular momentum reaches a simplified form $I_x^2=(I+\frac{1}{2})^2$. The value of $K$ is typically the band-head's angular momentum \cite{bengtsson1979quasiparticle,bengtsson1984signature}. Alternatively, for a sequence of states where $\Delta I=2\hbar$, the rotational frequency is usually calculated as:
\begin{align}
    \omega\equiv\hbar\omega_\text{rot}(I)=\frac{E_\gamma(I\to I-2)}{2}\ .
    \label{rotational-frequency-canonical}
\end{align}

% A more concise definition for the rotational frequency is related to the transition between two consecutive states $I+1\to I-1$ within a rotational band: a unique value of $\omega$ is attributed to the spin $I$, which is defined as a mean value of the two angular momenta from the corresponding transition. Such a construction will yield a set of discrete points $\omega(I)$, and one can obtain a `continuous' function $\omega(I)$ together with its inverse $I(\omega)$, thus making the term $I$ from Eq. \ref{aligned-angular-momentum} to be in fact $I(\omega)$.

The rotational frequency is used to represent many quantities that characterize collective motion and nuclear deformation. Representing the total or the aligned angular momenta as functions of $\omega$ can show wether multiple bands have the same nature. Moreover, representing the MOI as function of $\omega$ will also give an insight on the intrinsic structure of the nucleus. Another interesting feature that is present in high-spin spectra of nuclei is the so-called \emph{backbending} phenomena. This phenomenon appears due to the Coriolis effect: nucleons can suffer a de-pairing that makes their a.m. to align with the rotational axis, causing a sharp increase in the MOI \cite{ring2004nuclear,kvasil2004backbending}. These kind of effects are correlated to high deformation, increased rotation, and change in the nucleonic alignment.

\subsubsection{Moments of Inertia}

This is a crucial quantity that describes the degree of deformation and asymmetry of the nuclear shape (remember discussion from Chapter \ref{theoretical-aspects}). It is possible to retrieve an \emph{experimental} value for the MOI by inferring the energy spacing between consecutive levels of a collective spectrum. A classification of types of MOI was done in Eq. \ref{eq-irrotational-rigid-mois}, where the MOI dependence on the deformation parameters and even the mass parameter $B_\lambda$ was shown. The most general expression for the MOI can be written as \cite{ahmad2021backbending}:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{I}=\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\left(\frac{\text{d}E}{\text{d}J(J+1)}\right)^{-1}\ ,
\end{align}
where the classical angular momentum $J$ is related to its quantum equivalent via the correction $J=I+1/2$ (see Eq. \ref{aligned-angular-momentum}). Practically, the derivative can be expressed in terms of the aligned angular momentum $I_x$. Moreover, there are two types of MOI describing the characteristics of the rotational bands: the \emph{kinematical} and \emph{dynamical} moments of inertia. The kinematic MOI is given by \cite{wu1992relation}:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{I}^{(1)}=\frac{\hbar I_x}{\omega}=\hbar^2 I_x\left(\frac{\text{d}E}{\text{d}I_x}\right)^{-1}\ ,
    \label{kinematic-moi-general}
\end{align}
% One can see why the aligned angular momentum is important, since its variation w.r.t. the energies lead to theoretical determinations of the kinematic MOI. From the observed intraband $E2$ transitions one can extract the (kinematic) moment of inertia via the rule:
% \begin{align}
%     \mathcal{I}^{(1)}(I-1)=\hbar^2\frac{2I-1}{E_\gamma(I,I-2)}\ ,
%     \label{kinematic-moi-energy-levels}
% \end{align}
% where $E_\gamma(I,I-2)$ represents the energy difference between two consecutive levels $E(I)$ and $E(I-2)$. The dependence on $I$ for this type of MOI makes its experimental determination to require some spin assignments to each state of the excited spectrum.
while the dynamic moment of inertia is expressed as \cite{wu1992relation}:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{I}^{(2)}(I)=\hbar\frac{\text{d}I_x}{\text{d}\omega}=\hbar^2\left(\frac{\text{d}^2E}{\text{d}I_x^2}\right)^{-1}\ ,
    \label{dynamic-moi-general}
\end{align}
or, equivalently, as:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{I}^{(2)}(I)=\hbar^2\frac{4}{\Delta E_\gamma(I)}=\hbar^2\frac{4}{E_\gamma(I+2,I)-E_\gamma(I,I-2)}\ .
    \label{dynamic-moi-energy-levels}
\end{align}

%Note that any calculations for the dynamical MOI does not require prior knowledge about the spin assignments. These two types of MOI are usually represented as function of the rotational frequency $\omega$. Since the total spin $I$ can be expressed as a function of rotational frequency, plotting the kinematic/dynamic MOI as function of angular momentum is also preferred. In the present work, these quantities are of high interest (graphical representations for different nuclei will be shown in a future chapter), their relative behavior will help characterize bands with similar nucleonic structure.

% An alternative description for these MOI can be done through the so-called $ab$ formula \cite{wu1992relation,wu1992spin}, where the energies corresponding to the rotational spectrum are parametrized as:
% \begin{align}
%     E(I)=a\left(\sqrt{1+bI(I+1)}-1\right)
%     \label{ab-formula}
% \end{align}

% Fitting the experimental data will produce a set of parameters $a$ and $b$ that will be used to get expressions for the kinematic and dynamic MOI:
% \begin{align}
%     \mathcal{I}^{(1)}=\mathcal{I}_0\left[1-\frac{(\hbar\omega)^2}{a^2b}\right]^{-1/2}\ ,\\
%     \mathcal{I}^{(2)}=\mathcal{I}_0\left[1-\frac{(\hbar\omega)^2}{a^2b}\right]^{-3/2}\ ,
% \end{align}
% where $\mathcal{I}_0$ is defined as the \emph{band-head} moment of inertia: $\mathcal{I}_0=\hbar^2/(ab)$. In fact, such an approach of determining the MOIs of several odd-$A$ nuclei will consist in a future work of the same team. 

As mentioned, the sharp or abrupt irregularities of the MOI with respect to the increase in rotational frequency is known as backbending. The Figs. \ref{fig-hfNuclei-mois} - \ref{fig-ErYbnuclei-mois} show experimental MOI as function of the squared rotational frequency.
\begin{figure}

\begin{figure}

    \label{fig-ErYbnuclei-mois}
\end{figure}

Indeed, by looking at the evolution of $\mathcal{I}$ from Figs. \ref{fig-hfNuclei-mois} - \ref{fig-ErYbnuclei-mois}, some sharp increases are noted. These are usually attributed to the centrifugal stretching in the rotational model \cite{davydov1960rotation}. Moreover, the constant increase in $\mathcal{I}$ is considered to occur due to the slow and constant quenching of the pairing correlations between nucleons \cite{mottelson1960effect}. The abrupt changes are explained as rapid phase transitions of the nucleonic matter \cite{krumlinde1974effect} exclusively due to the Coriolis Anti-Pairing effect. On the other hand, backbending can also be explained via the band-crossing of two intersecting bands having different moments of inertia. Certainly, the \emph{non-crossing} effect (see Appendix \ref{appendix:two-state}) makes the bands approach each other as much as the interaction strength allows \cite{ring2004nuclear}. 
%Nevertheless, it is clear that the theoretical investigations point out the reduction of pairing correlations, which will affect the MOI at low spin. Finally, the alignment of nucleons will eventually cause backbending \cite{Stephens1974BackbendingAR,Stephens1972CoriolisEI}. 

% The band crossing is shown in Fig. \ref{bands-crossing-backbending}. This phenomenon starts from the idea of two bands with different moments of inertia: if one analyzes the plot of the energies w.r.t. the angular momentum $I$, at one point (a \emph{critical value} for $I$), the second band would intersect the first one, crossing it. But such a thing is forbidden, so there will be a change in behavior for the parabolas (left side plot from Fig. \ref{bands-crossing-backbending}), causing a simultaneous increase in total angular momentum and decrease in rotational frequency. This change in behavior is superimposed with the change in structure of the bands themselves, making the sharp transition possible. For small interaction strength between the two bands, the backbending will be quite `strong', while for large values the transition region is very broad, making the backbending non-occurring.
% \begin{figure}

%     \label{bands-crossing-backbending}
% \end{figure}

Usually, the graphical representations of the MOI (kinematic or dynamic) as functions of $\omega$ (or, equivalently, $I$) are useful when comparing multiple spectra in the same nucleus. Based on their behavior w.r.t. rotational frequency or spin, one can determine if the bands belong to the same intrinsic structure.
%For example, after spin and parity assignments of each energy state within the collective spectra of the odd-$A$ nucleus $^{163}$Lu, it is of interest to see how many sequences have \emph{normal deformation}, which single-particle + core couplings are preferred, if the bands have enhanced (strong) deformation, and so on. In the following chapters, a detailed overview with the evolution of the kinematic and dynamic MOI as a function of rotational frequencies for odd-$A$ around $A\approx 160$ nuclei will be made, since it plays a major role in the study of highly deformed nuclei. 
%The experimental data concerning $^{163}$Lu isotope allows one to check the experimental rotational frequencies $\hbar\omega(I)$, the \emph{alignment} $I_x$, and the two types of MOI which were discussed. These calculations are shown in Figs.
% A discussion about the backbending effect needs to be made, since it strictly connects to the paragraph just discussed above. Actually, within the region $10\sim20$ units of angular momentum this strange effect is observed, especially in the ground-state band (i.e., the \emph{yrast} band). The yrast line corresponds to the set of lowest energies for a given set of spin states \cite{bohr1954rotational}. In the work of Mariscotti el al. \cite{Mariscotti1969PhenomenologicalAO}, it was shown that for the lowest two orders, the moments of inertia can be approximated as $\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{I}_0+\mathcal{I}_1\omega^2$.

\subsubsection{Electric Quadrupole Moment}
\label{intro-EM-chapter3}

An important indicator of nuclear deformation is the \emph{electric quadrupole moment} \cite{hamamoto2016interplay}, which measures the `departure' of the nuclear shape away from spherical symmetry (through elongation and asymmetry). The most general expression of the intrinsic quadrupole moment for a rotating nucleus is given in terms of its \emph{charge density distribution} \cite{casten2000nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    Q_0=\int(3z^2-r^2)\rho(r)_\text{charge}\text{d}v\ .
    \label{general-quadrupole-moment-Q0-charge}
\end{align}

This shows how the nuclear charge distribution inside the nucleus plays a pivotal role in determining the nuclear deformation. A relationship between the deformation parameter $\beta$ and the quadrupole moment itself can be approximated (in second order of $\beta$) as \cite{krane1991introductory}:
\begin{align}
    Q_0=\frac{3}{\sqrt{5\pi}}R^2Z\beta(1+0.16\beta)\ ,
    \label{quadrupole-moment-Q0}
\end{align}
where $R$ is given as $R=R_0A^{1/3}$ and $R_0=1.2\ \text{fm}$. For values of $\beta$ that correspond to \emph{strongly deformed} nuclei (i.e., $\beta\sim 0.3$), higher order terms are not necessary. According to the discussion concerning the nuclear shapes, $\beta$ describes the eccentricity of the deformed ellipsoid (albeit prolate or oblate). The difference between a prolate and oblate ellipsoid is that for prolate (oblate) case there is an \emph{extension} in one (two) direction and a \emph{squeezing} in the other two (one). Depending on the value of $\beta$, the quadrupole moments for nuclei will be positive (indicating a prolate deformation) or negative (giving an oblate deformation). The experimental values of $\beta_2$ for rare-earth nuclei are shown in Fig. \ref{fig-quadrupole-beta-nuclides}. Note that for $\beta_2$ the subscript `2' will be used or dismissed freely throughout this work, but it will signify the same quantity. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/quadrupole_Deformation_rareEarth.pdf}
    \caption{The quadrupole deformation parameter $\beta_2$ as a function of the mass number $A$ for a few isotopes in the rare-earth region. These values were determined from the experimental transition probabilities $0^+\to 2^+$. The figure is reproduced from Ref. \cite{casten2000nuclear}.}
    \label{fig-quadrupole-beta-nuclides}
\end{figure}

In order to understand the behavior of $\beta_2$ shown in Fig. \ref{fig-quadrupole-beta-nuclides}, some shell-model considerations need to be taken into account. Firstly, when deformation kicks in, the individual $j$ orbits within a major shell are nearly empty, resulting in positive values for the quadrupole moments of the nucleons from these orbits. With increasing deformation, large and positive values $Q(\beta)$ are present. Furthermore, as the shells start to fill, contributions from individual $j$ orbits to the total quadrupole moment will accumulate, making its value to decrease, vanish, and eventually becoming negative near the shell closure \cite{casten2000nuclear}. %(see inset 3 in Fig. 5.4 from \cite{casten2000nuclear}).

The \emph{observed} quadrupole moment (also known as \emph{spectroscopic} or \emph{measured}) can be obtained via a transformation to the laboratory frame applied to $Q_0$, meaning that the spectroscopic quadrupole moment has the result \cite{casten2000nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    Q=\left[\frac{3K^2-I(I+1)}{(I+1)(2I+3)}\right]Q_0\ ,
    \label{quadrupole-moment-spectro}
\end{align}
where the quantum number $K$ is the projection of $I$ onto the symmetry (deformation) axis. The dependence of $Q$ on both $K$ and $I$ emphasizes the fact that the observed shape of a rotating nucleus is not equivalent to the shape in the intrinsic frame of reference. Consider the case of a prolate nucleus rotating about an axis that is perpendicular to the symmetry axis. Then the \emph{averaged} density distribution of the nuclear matter will look more like an oblate shape (see Fig. \ref{fig-averaged-prolate-density}). As a result, when the intrinsic quadrupole moment is positive, the observed one will have a negative value, resulting in the $I(I+1)>3K^2$ condition from Eq. \ref{quadrupole-moment-spectro}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Chapters/Figures/averaged_nuclearMatter_prolate.pdf}
    \caption{The average flattened (oblate) density distribution generated by the rotation of a prolate nucleus. As the `initial' prolate nucleus with its nuclear density (represented by the gray ellipse with dashed borders) being distributed along the deformed axis exhibits rotation, the rotated shape will generate an averaged oblate disk along the rotational axis (represented by the blue). This is why the observed quadrupole moment $Q$ will have a negative sign if $Q_0>0$.}
    \label{fig-averaged-prolate-density}
\end{figure}

Another important quantity used as a `test' for collectivity and deformation is the \emph{reduced electric quadrupole transition probability}, or $B(E2)$. This transition probability can be given in terms of the quadrupole moment introduced in Eq. \ref{general-quadrupole-moment-Q0-charge} through the following form \cite{bohr1998nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    B(E2;\ I_i\to I_f)=\frac{5}{16\pi}e^2Q_0^2\bra{I_iK20}\ket{I_fK}^2\ ,
    \label{reduced-E2-clebsch-gordan}
\end{align}
where the squared factor $\bra{I_iK20}\ket{I_fK}^2$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, also written as $\bra{I_iK20}\ket{I_fK}\equiv C^{I_i2I_f}_{K0K}$. In the case of $0^+\to 2^+$ transition, the reduced probability will be given by \cite{casten2000nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    B(E2;\ 0^+\to 2^+)=\frac{5}{16\pi}e^2Q_0^2\ .
    \label{reduced-E2-0Plus-2Plus-Transition}
\end{align}

The transition probability provided in Eq. \ref{reduced-E2-clebsch-gordan} is in fact a special case that can be applied to nuclei possessing \emph{axial symmetry}. This is because the involved transitions are not affected by a change of the projection $K$.
%A more general treatment of $B(E2)$ also requires prior knowledge of the so-called \emph{electric quadrupole transition operator}, which are not adopted here yet. This will be properly employed in a future chapter when discussing the transition probabilities in several odd-mass nuclei. 
From the quadratic dependence of the intrinsic quadrupole moment on $\beta$, high values (e.g. $\beta\approx 0.3$) will lead to $B(E2)$ that are one or even two orders of magnitude higher than those specific to nearly spherical nuclei $\beta_\text{sph}\approx 0.05$. Usually in nuclei, the valence nucleons are causing some core polarizations, which will affect the `final' structure of the electric quadrupole moment. For example, in an odd-$Z$ and even-$N$ nucleus, the total quadrupole moment $Q$ (also referred to as \emph{single-particle quadrupole moment} $Q_\text{s.p.}$) is given by the following expression \cite{bertulani2007nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    Q=-\langle r^2\rangle\frac{2j-1}{2j+2}\frac{e_\text{eff}}{e}\equiv Q_\text{s.p.}\ ,
    \label{single-particle-quadrupole-moment}
\end{align}
where $e_\text{eff}$ represents the \emph{effective charge} of the nucleus \cite{heyde1994nuclear}. The mean squared radius corresponds to the radial function of the particle within that $j$ orbital. 
%Stable nuclear deformation will require that the nuclear energy should be minimal. This can be achieved either if the overlap of the core with the valence particle is maximal, which for  a particle+core interaction will produce an oblate polarization, driving the nucleus to a final oblate deformed state. The opposite is true for the hole+core coupling (see discussion made in \cite{neugart2006nuclear}).
An interesting characteristic emerging from Eq. \ref{single-particle-quadrupole-moment} is that odd-$A$ nuclei having $I=1/2$ will give a vanishing quadrupole moment $Q$. Although this situation concerns the measured (i.e., the observed) moment, the odd-$A$ nucleus with $I=1/2$ does not necessarily imply that the system has no quadrupole moment. In fact, according to Eq. \ref{quadrupole-moment-spectro}, the spectroscopic moment is expressed in terms of the intrinsic component $Q_0$, so it is possible to have a vanishing $Q$ while $Q_0$ is non-zero. The same circumstance is also met for the case of even-even nuclei.

The experimental data from Fig. \ref{experimental-Q-odd-nuclei} show the magnitude of $Q$ that would correspond to the value given by Eq. \ref{single-particle-quadrupole-moment}. One can see sharp increases with the nucleonic number for some nuclei (e.g., $^{167}$Er or $^{175}$Lu) but also some very strong decreases to negative values (e.g., $^{123}$Sn). These alternations between positive (prolate) and negative (oblate) $Q$ values are also located near the magic numbers. Moreover, when the odd-particle is a neutron, the nucleus still exhibits a non-zero quadrupole moment, meaning that to some extent, the last nucleon is not the sole player regarding the quantitative behavior of $Q$.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{Chapters/Figures/Exp_quadrupoleMoments.pdf}
    \caption{The measured quadrupole moments $Q$ as per Eq. \ref{single-particle-quadrupole-moment}, given in units of $ZR^2$, as function of the odd proton ($Z$) and neutron ($N$) numbers, respectively (arrows signify the magic numbers). Experimental data are taken from Ref. \cite{bertulani2007nuclear}.}
    \label{experimental-Q-odd-nuclei}
\end{figure}

The experimental data for $Q$ (the spectroscopic quadrupole moment in units of \emph{barn} or $\text{b}$) for the lowest $2^+$ states of even-$Z$ and even-$N$ nuclei are graphically represented in Fig. \ref{experimental-quadrupole-2Plus-states}, where both positive and negative values can be observed. As already explained, a negative $Q$ value ($Q=-2\ \text{b}$ for nuclei with permanent deformation belonging to the mass range $150\leq A \leq 190$) will correspond to an intrinsic quadrupole moment $Q_0=7\ \text{b}$, which results in deformation parameter $\beta\approx 0.29$. Such values indicate substantial eccentricities of the nuclear matter.

\section{Triaxial Nuclei and Their Signatures}
\label{section-triaxial-signatures}

In the following chapter, a theoretical background on triaxiality will be presented. It is important to understand why the nuclear community focuses their attention on highly deformed nuclei. Moreover, having a clear picture with the unique characteristics of these nuclei helps one to identify and construct a set of \emph{fingerprints} that will be considered `tests' when searching and studying the nuclei.
%Presenting the theoretical formalism that is used to describe triaxial nuclei, and mention the \emph{fingerprints} of nuclear triaxiality is that last step before diving into the recently developed framework for odd-$A$ nuclei which the team created, and showing the results. 

\subsection{Non-axial nuclei}

The discussion regarding excitation energies of a rigid rotor from the previous chapter was focused on pure rotors or nuclei with axially symmetric shapes (i.e,, prolate or oblate). Remember that deformation is still required in order to define a collective spectra with rotational character. Moreover, the relevant quantities that are involved in the rotational motion for a deformed nucleus are the moments of inertia corresponding to the principal axes of the deformed ellipsoid: $\mathcal{I}_{1,2,3}$, and within previous calculations, two moments of inertia were supposed to be identical.

Even though calculations are performed with the rigid-like MOI or the irrotational-like, their dependence on the deformation parameters $\beta_2$ and $\gamma$ is present (recall expressions given in Eq. \ref{eq-irrotational-rigid-mois}). Taking a closer look at their evolution with $\gamma$, one can see that indeed, similar MOI can only occur at certain values (see Fig. \ref{fig-irrotational-rigid-mois}). When referring to their ground state, nuclei can be regarded as such:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spherical:} all MOI are equal and no deformations are present
    \item \textbf{Axially-symmetric:} two identical MOI and $\beta_2$ parameter plays a role in characterizing the nuclear shapes 
    \item \textbf{Triaxial:} all three MOI are different, the quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ and also the triaxiality parameter $\gamma$ are describing the nuclear shapes
\end{itemize}

Most of the isotopes are either spherical or symmetric in their ground state \cite{budaca2018tilted}, but triaxial shapes might occur as ground state \cite{moller2006global}.
%The apparition of triaxial nuclei implies some kind of `stability' on the $\gamma$-parameter, since a dynamical character of the triaxiality will indicate transitional states rather than nuclear stability. 
A rigid (fixed) value for $\gamma$ is required such that triaxial stable nuclei can exist.
%Thus, one can distinguish between the $\gamma$-soft nuclei in which this parameter has a dynamical character and the $\gamma$-rigid ones, which could in fact exhibit stable triaxial deformation \cite{dracoulis2013isomers}.
Thus, one can distinguish between the $\gamma$-soft and $\gamma$-rigid nuclei.
Even more interesting are the structures occurring at very large values of quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ and $\gamma\approx 30^\circ$ (where maximal triaxiality occurs). It will be shown that these nuclei will lead to band structures that are called \emph{Triaxial Strongly Deformed} bands (TSD) \cite{odegaard2001evidence,jensen2002evidence}. Triaxial nuclei are a special class of nuclei, where an asymmetry between the moments of inertia (given by a $\gamma$ value within the corresponding interval), and moreover, the quadrupole deformation is high enough such that it stabilizes the entire system.

\subsection{Triaxial Rotor Model}
\label{trm-model}

The general Hamiltonian for a \emph{triaxial system} is given in terms of the components of the total angular momentum operator $\hat{I}$ and the moments of inertia for the deformed ellipsoid, similarly as it was the case for the \emph{rotational Hamiltonian} within the symmetric case:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}=\frac{\hat{I}_1^2}{2\mathcal{I}_1}+\frac{\hat{I}_2^2}{2\mathcal{I}_2}+\frac{\hat{I}_3^2}{2\mathcal{I}_3}\ ,
    \label{general-rotor-hamiltonian}
\end{align}
where the indices correspond to each of the principal axes of the rotational ellipsoid.
%(principal axes are the ones in which the components of the MOI tensor are diagonal).
More often, the notations $A_{1,2,3}=\hbar^2/\left(2\mathcal{I}_{1,2,3}\right)$ are used in the Hamiltonian's expression, leading to $A_1\neq A_2\neq A_3$ for the triaxial nuclei. Shi et al. \cite{wen2015wobbling} show a very straightforward way of obtaining the eigenvalues for the \emph{triaxial rigid rotor}, following the quantum treatment made by Davydov and Filippov for the rigid rotor without symmetry axis \cite{davydov1958rotational}:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}&=\hat{H}_\text{diag}+\hat{H}_\text{non-diag}\ ,\nonumber\\
    \hat{H}_\text{diag}&=\left[\frac{1}{2}\left(A_1+A_2\right)\left(\hat{I}^2-\hat{I}_3^2\right)+A_3\hat{I}_3^2\right]\ ,\nonumber\\
    \hat{H}_\text{non-diag}&=\frac{1}{4}\left(A_1-A_2\right)\left(\hat{I}_+^2+\hat{I}_-^2\right)\ .
\end{align}
Expressing the Hamiltonian in this way is useful because there is a clear difference between a diagonal term and one that mixes states with different $K$ (i.e., $\Delta K=\pm2$). It is important to emphasize that this kind of Hamiltonian is still invariant to rotations with $\pi$ around the principal axes, meaning that the eigenvalue problem can be solved with the basis $\ket{IMK}$, were the wave-function is described as \cite{wen2015wobbling}:
\begin{align}
    \ket{IMK}=\sqrt{\frac{2I+1}{16\pi^2(1+\delta_{K0})}}\left[\ket{IMK}+(-)^I\ket{IM-K}\right]\ ,
\end{align}
where $\ket{IM\pm K}$ are the Wigner $\mathcal{D}$-functions, which determine the \emph{orientation} of the nucleus itself. The $K$ quantum number is the projection of $I$ onto the 3-axis of the body-fixed frame (intrinsic frame of reference), and $M$ represents the projection of $I$ onto the $z$-axis of the laboratory frame. This wave-function is quite similar to the one defined in Eq. \ref{RAL-bands-wave-function} from Appendix \ref{appendix:ral-dal-signature-scheme}. Indeed, by using these functions as a basis, the total Hamiltonian can be diagonalized in the following manner \cite{wen2015wobbling}:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_{IK}=\frac{1}{2}(A_1+A_2)\left[I(I+1)-K^2\right]+A_3K^2\ ,
\end{align}
with the notation $H_{IK}\equiv\bra{IK}\hat{H}\ket{IK}$. The non-diagonal term will have the energy states given as \cite{wen2015wobbling}:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_{IK\pm2}=\frac{1}{4}(A_1-A_2)\sqrt{(I\mp K)(I\pm K +1)(I \mp K -1)(I\pm K +2)}\ ,
\end{align}
where $\hat{H}_{IK\pm 2}\equiv \bra{IK}\hat{H}\ket{IK\pm 2}$. %Finally, using these matrix elements, the energies can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation for given spins $I$.
Such calculations were performed by the team for $^{158}$Er (see Fig. 8 from  \cite{raduta2017semiclassical}) and the results of the diagonalization procedure were in complete agreement with alternative descriptions for $\hat{H}$.

\subsection{Triaxial Particle + Rotor Model}
\label{tprm-model}

In this section, the Hamiltonian for a system composed of one single-particle and a triaxial core, which is usually applied to odd-$A$ nuclei, will be discussed. In fact, the main framework that will be described in the remaining chapters starts from the triaxial PRM \cite{davydov1958rotational}. Davydov et al. developed the triaxial PRM model for explaining the low-lying collective spectra of $2^+$ states within transitional nuclei. The Hamiltonian of this system is composed of a term for the even-even core and another one for a single-particle \emph{moving in a quadrupole deformed mean-field}:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}=\hat{H}_\text{rot}+\hat{H}'_\text{sp}\ .
    \label{triaxial-prm-general-hamiltonian}
\end{align}

Here, an important observation must be made regarding the second term. Usually, the single-particle Hamiltonian $\hat{H}'_\text{sp}$ is composed of an \emph{intrinsic energy} coming from the $j$-shell in which the nucleon is orbiting, and an \emph{effective energy} that characterizes the interaction between the particle and the core, which has a quadrupole nature. Consequently, the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}'_\text{sp}$ should be written as: $$\hat{H}'_\text{sp}=\hat{h}_0^j+\hat{H}_\text{int}^\text{quad}\ ,$$where $\hat{h}_0^j$ is the former term and $\hat{H}_\text{int}^\text{quad}$ is the latter one.
%the contribution of the total particle energy coming from the position of the $j$-shell and $\hat{H}_\text{int}^\text{quad}$ is the interaction of the valence nucleon with the even-even core (that is of quadrupole type). 
For example, Ring et al. \cite{ring2004nuclear} uses the SHO for describing $\hat{h}_0^j$. The interaction Hamiltonian is in fact a $\gamma$-deformed Nilsson potential, which was previously discussed (see Section \ref{nilsson-model-section}), with its general expression:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_\text{int}^\text{quad}=\kappa\beta r^2\left[\cos\gamma Y_{2}^{0}+\frac{\sin\gamma}{\sqrt{2}}\left(Y_2^2+Y_2^{-2}\right)\right].
    \label{quadrupole-deformed-potential-beta}
\end{align}
Furthermore, this deformed potential gives the energy splittings for the nucleonic orbits (recall the Nilsson diagrams from Figs. \ref{nillson-diagram} - \ref{nillson-diagram-2}), and it can be expressed in terms of the atomic mass $A$ and the quadrupole deformation parameter $\beta_2$ \cite{peng2003description}:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_\text{int}^\text{quad}=\frac{206}{A^{1/3}}\beta_2\left[\cos\gamma Y_2^0+\frac{\sin\gamma}{\sqrt{2}}(Y_2^2+Y_2^{-2})\right]\ .
    \label{quadrupole-deformed-potential-V}
\end{align}
However, the generalized expressions from Eqs. \ref{quadrupole-deformed-potential-beta} - \ref{quadrupole-deformed-potential-V} can be re-written for a single-particle characterized by its total angular momentum $\mathbf{j}$ in the following way:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_\text{int}^\text{quad}=\frac{V}{j(j+1)}\left[\cos\gamma(3j_z^2-\mathbf{j}^2)-\sqrt{3}\sin\gamma(j_x^2-j_y^2)\right]\ ,
    \label{single-particle-nilsson-defored-potential}
\end{align}
where the entire interaction strength between the particle and the core is embedded in the \emph{single-particle potential strength} $V$. This parameter is very important in the present research, since the theoretical results regarding energy spectra are obtained through the numerical determination of $V$. Obviously, the three components of the single-particle angular momentum are represented by $j_x$, $j_y$, and $j_z$.

Peng et al. \cite{peng2003description} gave a description for odd-odd nuclei within $A\approx 100$ and $A\approx 130$ mass regions using a Hamiltonian in which two valence nucleons were coupled to the triaxial core. Indeed, their Hamiltonian was constructed in the following way:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}=\hat{H}_\text{intr}+\hat{H}_{coll}\ ,
\end{align}
where $\hat{H}_\text{coll}$ is the typical rotor Hamiltonian (such as the one defined in Eq. \ref{general-rotor-hamiltonian}) and $\hat{H}_\text{intr}$ represents the sum of a proton and neutron contribution:
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_\text{intr}=h_p+h_n\ .
    \label{intrinsic-proton-neutron-hamiltonian}
\end{align}
The term $\hat{H}_\text{intr}$ can be viewed as an intrinsic part that describes the deformation of the core and the motion of the nucleons within the mean-field. A remarking feature of this approach is that the problem can be extrapolated to a case with multiple protons and neutrons, invoking some sort of `scalability' of their model. The single-particle energies for protons and neutrons from Eq. \ref{intrinsic-proton-neutron-hamiltonian} have a similar form as the one stated in Eq. \ref{single-particle-nilsson-defored-potential}, namely it is given as:
\begin{align}
    h_{p(n)}=\pm\frac{1}{2}C_\beta\left[\left(j_3^2-\frac{j(j+1)}{3}\right)\cos\gamma+\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}(j_+^2+j_-^2)\sin\gamma\right]\ ,
    \label{single-particle-energies-hpn}
\end{align}
with the alternating signs corresponding to the proton and neutron, respectively. Note the switch of axes labelling from $(x,y,z)$ to $(1,2,3)$, and the introduction of ladder operators $(j_+,j_-)$. The \emph{coupling parameter} $C_\beta$ is a measure of energy (typically expressed in MeV) and its value depends linearly on $\beta_2$:
\begin{align}
    C_\beta=\frac{195}{j(j+1)}\frac{1}{A^{1/3}}\beta_2\ .
\end{align}

It is worth giving quantitative results on the quadrupole potential and the single-particle Hamiltonian described above. As such, a simple numerical application will be employed, obtaining graphical representations with the behavior of these quantities with respect to the deformation parameters. Firstly, the potential $\hat{H}_\text{int}^\text{quad}$ will be analyzed in the polar plane defined by the angles $(\theta,\varphi)$. For nuclei near the $A\approx 160$ region, it is common to have values of $\beta_2\in\left[0.2,0.4\right]$ and $\gamma\approx 20^\circ$. %, so for testing purposes one can take $\beta_2$ and $\gamma$ within those ranges. 
The quadrupole potential $\hat{H}_\text{int}^\text{quad}$ is numerically evaluated, and the results can be seen in Figs. \ref{figs-deformed-quadrupole-potential-1} - \ref{figs-deformed-quadrupole-potential-2}.
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Concerning the numerical evaluation of $h$ given in Eq. \ref{single-particle-energies-hpn} (hereafter, the indices $p,n$ are dismissed), one can take the diagonal components of $h$ and apply the rules only for one proton. As a result, the \emph{mixing terms} $j_+$ and $j_-$ from $h$ will not contribute at all, since their average with the protonic states $\ket{jk}$ will give zero. Only the $(j_3^2-j(j+1)/3)$ term will affect the diagonal components of $h$. For a proton state $\ket{jk}$, where $k=-j,\dots,j$, the diagonal element $\bra{jk}h\ket{jk}$ will be:
\begin{align}
    h_{jk}\equiv\bra{jk}h\ket{jk}=\frac{1}{2}C_\beta\cos\gamma\bra{jk}\left(j_3^2-\frac{j(j+1)}{3}\right)\ket{jk}\ ,
    \label{hdiag-equation-general}
\end{align}
which can be simplified to:
\begin{align}
    h_{jk}=\frac{1}{2}C_\beta\cos\gamma\left(k^2-\frac{j(j+1)}{3}\right)\ .
    \label{hdiag-equation}
\end{align}
These matrix elements will be functions of deformation parameters and projection $k$ of the particle's angular momentum onto the $3$-axis. Since $j_3$ is applied twice on $\ket{jk}$ state, the final result will be $k^2$, so only the positive values can be considered for the numerical application $k=1/2,\dots,j$. The qualitative evolution of $h_{jk}$ as function of $\beta_2$ and $\gamma$ is studied for a nucleus with $A=167$ in which the odd-particle is either a proton in the $h_{11/2}$-shell or in the $i_{13/2}$-shell. The behavior of $h_{jk}$ w.r.t. the quadrupole deformation parameter can be seen in Fig. \ref{hdiag-beta-evolution}, while Fig. \ref{hdiag-gamma-evolution} shows the behavior of $h_{jk}$ w.r.t. the triaxiality parameter $\gamma$.

    \label{hdiag-gamma-evolution}
\end{figure}

In reference to this evaluation, one can observe the fact that the single-particle energies are independent on the sign of $\gamma$ (since cosine is an even function). However, this is not the case when calculations are done for the non-diagonal elements, because states with different $k$ will add contributions to $h$ via the sine function. For the evolution of $h_{jk}$ wr.t. $\gamma$, one can see that the lines in Fig. \ref{hdiag-beta-evolution} are almost similar, indicating that the diagonal components are not very sensitive to nuclear triaxiality. On the other hand, a difference in $\beta_2$ between the components will result in large gaps. Going back to the general Hamiltonian given in Eq. \ref{triaxial-prm-general-hamiltonian} and putting together Eqs. \ref{quadrupole-deformed-potential-beta} - \ref{single-particle-nilsson-defored-potential}, it can be brought to a `final' form. The rotor part, the single-particle contributions, and the quadrupole deformation of the mean-field are clearly depicted \cite{ring2004nuclear}:
\begin{align}
    % \hat{H}=\sum_i\frac{R_i^2}{2\mathcal{I}_i}+h_0^j+\kappa\beta r^2\left[\cos\gamma Y_2^0+\frac{\sin\gamma}{\sqrt{2}}\left(Y_2^2+Y_2^{-2}\right)\right]\ ,\\ 
    \hat{H}=\sum_{i=1}^3\frac{R_i^2}{2\mathcal{I}_i}+h_0^j+\frac{V}{j(j+1)}\left[\cos\gamma(3j_3^2-\mathbf{j}^2)-\sqrt{3}\sin\gamma(j_1^2-j_2^2)\right]\ .
    \label{eq-triaxial-prm-full-hamiltonian}
\end{align}

% Regarding the dynamical character of $\hat{H}$ defined in Eq. \ref{eq-triaxial-prm-full-hamiltonian}, the coupling of high-$j$ particle with a rotor will create physical effects which can be classified in the following way \cite{ring2004nuclear}:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item rotational energy is always minimized by the rotation of the core around the axis with the largest MOI
%     \item alignment of the odd particle will always prefer a maximal mass overlap with the core (this configuration minimizes the potential energy the most)
%     \item the Coriolis effect will always tend to align the particle with the core, in terms of their a.m.
% \end{itemize}

Concluding this section, the energy spectrum for an odd-$A$ nucleus can be described using the triaxial PRM. It is a starting ground for many theoretical descriptions that aim at confirming and predicting phenomena specific to highly deformed nuclei.

\subsection{Stable Triaxial Deformation}
\label{potential-energy-surfaces-section}

The stability of a triaxial nucleus is related to the presence (existence) of minima within the \emph{Potential Energy Surface} \cite{ring2004nuclear}. This energy surface characterizes the shape of the nucleus with respect to the deformation parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$. 
% One can speculate on the fact that for an ellipsoidal shape, the total energy at a fixed angular momentum, function of the deformation will be given as \cite{ring2004nuclear}:
% \begin{align}
%     E(\beta,\gamma,I)=E_\text{LDM}(\beta,\gamma,I)+E_\text{shell}(\beta,\gamma,I)-\bar{E}_\text{corr}(\beta,\gamma,I)\ ,
%     \label{energy-surface-correction-terms}
% \end{align}
% where $E_\text{LDM}$ is the deformation energy for a rotating ellipsoid (characterized by the rigid-like MOI, since at high spin values this approximation holds true), $E_\text{shell}$ is the energy within the shell model (can even use the Nilsson's deformed variant), and $\bar{E}_\text{corr}$ is usually calculated as an \emph{averaged value} of the Nilsson-Strutinsky corrected potential \cite{brack1972funny} (which is beyond the scope of this work). Finding these energies can be done by working at constant $\omega$ or at constant I, when diagonalizing the deformed-single particle potential in the rotating frame \cite{ring2004nuclear}.
% Solving thus Eq. \ref{energy-surface-correction-terms} results in having a \emph{qualitative} analysis for the behavior of the nucleonic matter at high spins. 
These solutions will consist of graphical representations in the $(\beta,\gamma)$-plane, where different values of the potential energy appear. Lower values represent a higher degree of stability. Typically one can find regions of stability across the plane with well-defined values for $\beta$ and $\gamma$ at which the nucleus is stable and deformed. On the other hand, if the energy variation is rather flat in the $\gamma$ degree of freedom, but centered around a finite $\beta$, then this nucleus is called \emph{$\gamma$-unstable}. These energy surfaces are a key indicator of stability with respect to the deformation parameters. Examples of energy surfaces for some nuclei are shown in Figs. \ref{pes-example-set-1} - \ref{pes-example-set-2}. It is remarkable the fact that small quantum fluctuations will exist around the minima. The energies depicted in Figs. \ref{pes-example-set-1} - \ref{pes-example-set-2} are created using a so-called \emph{Ultimate Cranker} code implementation, which has been developed in Refs. \cite{bengtsson1989method,bengtsson1990high}. This implementation is based on a Nilsson deformed potential with pairing interaction included, and it is able to give the values for $(\beta,\gamma)$ at which a nucleus might achieve stability, practically identifying local and global minima within the potential energy surface.

\end{figure}

Within the $A\approx160$ mass region there are several nuclei in which TSD bands are identified. Best example are the results concerning Lu-Hf isotopes, where more than 20 such bands were experimentally confirmed \cite{gu2007theoretical}. It is interesting that the nuclei with even $N$ (especially the Lu isotopes) have ground TSD bands emerging from a configuration based on the $\pi=i_{13/2}$ nucleon. In fact, Ødegård et al. \cite{odegaard2001evidence} point out the fact that nuclei with proton number $Z\approx 71$ and neutron number $N\approx 94$ have stable triaxial shapes around the values $(\beta_2,\gamma)=(0.38,\pm 20^\circ)$.
% Given the degree of shell filling, only some specific triaxial shapes with fixed value of $\gamma$ are favored by the aligned particle (see Ref. \cite{hamamoto1983intrinsic} for more details). In the case of $^{163}$Lu, the aligned proton from $j=13/2$ shell favors a triaxiality of $\gamma=20^\circ$ (see Fig. \ref{pes-example-set-2}). Similarly, other nuclei will have different high-$j$ nucleon configurations which will drive the system to large triaxial deformations, by favoring a particular value of $\gamma$.
Now that the stability of asymmetric nuclear shapes has been visualized in terms of energy surfaces and deformation parameters, it is instructive to understand how one can identify triaxial nuclei (both experimentally and theoretically). This will be done in the following section.

\subsection{Fingerprints of Triaxiality}

Within recent years, it has been shown that triaxiality plays an important role on features such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculating nucleon separation energies \cite{moller2006global}
    \item Protonic emission probabilities \cite{qi2019recent,budaca2022deformation}
    \item Determination of fission barrier height \cite{moller2009heavy,lu2012potential}
    \item Nuclear fragmentation \cite{palumbo1985splitting}
\end{itemize}

On the experimental side, a tremendous effort was made in order to construct setups that can study nuclei at very high spins (were collective phenomena previously discussed appear). Unfortunately, measuring triaxiality directly is still quite challenging \cite{hamamoto2016interplay,budaca2018tilted}. Over the last 25 years, with the advance in technology of detectors \cite{henning2012stability}, some large facilities were built, with the sole purpose of studying with great degree of precision high-spin states of nuclei. Facilities such as the EUROBALL \cite{simpson1997euroball} or GAMMASPHERE \cite{lee1990gammasphere} opened \emph{new frontiers} on the nuclear physics at high-spin; being able to measure excited spectra of nuclei having angular momentum within the range $60-80\hbar$. Regarding the reactions involved, most of the measurements of highly excited (and rapidly rotating) are obtained through \emph{Fusion-Evaporation Reactions}. Since this work does not focus on the experimental setups and procedures, only some literature covering these reactions are mentioned \cite{gu2007theoretical,henning2012stability,ayangeakaa2013exotic,matta2017exotic,das2018nuclear,lewis2019lifetime,sensharma2021wobbling}.

Even though stable triaxiality is an elusive phenomenon, \emph{two clear fingerprints} are known to pinpoint asymmetric nuclear shapes: \textbf{wobbling motion} and \textbf{chiral symmetry breaking}. There has been an extensive study of these two phenomena, and both indicate a clear lack of symmetry for the underlying nuclei. Since wobbling is the main focus of this work, a brief introduction for chiral symmetry breaking will be made below, while a separated chapter will be devoted to the experimental evidence and theoretical studies regarding wobbling motion.

\subsection{Chiral motion}
\label{chiral-section}

Firstly introduced by Frauendorf \cite{frauendorf1997tilted}, it concerns nuclei in which the nucleonic configurations lead to a system that lacks \emph{chiral symmetry}, meaning that the \emph{left-handed} version is not identical with the \emph{right-handed} one. The two systems can be transformed into each other via the chiral operator by combining a rotation with the time-reversal operator: $\chi_\text{chiral}=\mathcal{T}\mathcal{R}(\pi)$. The left/right handedness of the nuclear system comes from the coupling of three different angular momenta, typically a valence proton, a valence neutron, and a rotational core. As such, the chiral symmetry breaking is expected to appear in odd-odd nuclei.

In that pioneering work, Frauendorf showed that for a triaxial nucleus, the collective angular momentum $\mathbf{R}$ will align along the intermediate ($m$) axis of the deformed ellipsoid (note that the $m$-axis is also the axis with largest MOI). The energy is minimized when the triaxial system rotates about the largest MOI, and for irrotational-like flow this corresponds to the $m$-axis. Regarding the valence nucleons (particles or holes), the location of their corresponding Fermi level will influence the alignment with the ellipsoid \cite{frauendorf1997tilted,starosta2001chiral}. For a valence proton located in the bottom part of the high-$j$ subshell, its a.m. will align with the short $s$-axis of the ellipsoid. Furthermore, a valence neutron located in the upper part of the shell will align its a.m. with the long $l$-axis. This type of alignment is related to the overlap between the quasi-particle wave-function and that of the triaxial core. For the particle + core coupling, a \emph{maximal overlap of their wave-functions will minimize the interaction energy}, hence the particle will align its a.m. with the short axis. On the other hand, for the hole + core coupling, \emph{the energy is minimized for a minimal overlap of the wave-functions}, meaning that the hole will tend to align its a.m. with the long axis. A further discussion on the overlap will be detailed in the next chapter.

When the chiral symmetry is broken in the intrinsic frame of reference (body-fixed frame), the restoration of the symmetry in the laboratory frame (through quantum tunnelling \cite{zhang2007chiral}) will manifest itself as the emergence of two (almost) degenerate doublet bands with $\Delta I=1\hbar$ \cite{frauendorf1997tilted}. This interesting behavior has been drawing a lot of attention lately, with most of the experimental identifications around the transitional nuclei $A\approx 130$. Over the years, a great amount of research towards a complete spectroscopy of chiral nuclei has been done in Refs. \cite{starosta2001chiral,meng2008chiral,budaca2018semiclassical,budaca2021chiral} and Refs. \cite{raduta2014new, raduta2014description, raduta2015semi, raduta2015possible, raduta2016specific, raduta2017alternative}. Examples of experimental chiral doublets for some odd-odd nuclei are shown in Figs. \ref{chiral-bands-1} - \ref{chiral-bands-2}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Chapters/Figures/Chiral_136Pm.pdf}

    \label{chiral-bands-2}
\end{figure}

The geometrical interpretation of the left-handed and right-handed systems can be seen in Fig. \ref{chiral-geometry}, where the ellipsoid is `surrounded' by the two valence nucleons, each with its aligned angular momentum. Regarding axes labelling, it is fully consistent with the one from Ref. \cite{frauendorf2001spontaneous} (i.e., see Table I therein).

The two valence nucleons are colored with blue (proton) and magenta (neutron). These figures were inspired from \cite{starosta2001chiral}. Considering the discussion regarding alignments, the proton a.m. $\mathbf{j}_\pi$ is aligned with the $s$-axis, the neutron a.m. $\mathbf{j}_\nu$ with the $l$-axis, and the even-even core a.m. $\mathbf{R}$ with the $m$-axis of the ellipsoid. The alignments for the core and the particles are described in text.}

\subsection{Wobbling Motion}

The second fingerprint of triaxiality is the main topic of this work, and it will be discussed in detail in the next chapter. A great amount of progress in understanding nuclear phenomena at high spin has been made by. Going back to the discussion about the triaxial shapes and their asymmetry between the MOI, this key feature leads to the possibility of defining a rotation about any of the three axis. Although most of rotational motion will be around the axis with the largest MOI (since this is energetically the cheapest \cite{bohr1954rotational}), the other two axes will contribute to a `total' (superimposed) rotation such that the angular momentum $\mathbf{I}$ of the system will precess around a steady position. The precessional motion has oscillator-like behavior, meaning that $\mathbf{I}$ will not only precess, but its projection around the principal axes will oscillate around a steady position. The easiest way of understanding wobbling motion is through the classical analog of the \emph{spinning asymmetric top}. However, the spinning motion for a nucleus is \emph{quantized} and a typical phonon number will be attributed to the system.

As it will be shown in the following chapter, treating the wobbling phenomenon in a `classical' picture will lead to very good results concerning the physical quantities of interest. Moreover, there are many attempts (albeit quantum mechanical or semi-classical approximations) at describing wobbling motion in which the parameters used to describe the Hamiltonian have clear physical meaning, keeping thus a close contact with well-defined concepts regarding system dynamics.

Other classical analogies for the nuclear wobbling motion can be seen in celestial bodies such as planets. Indeed, Earth has a precession given by its rotation and a small amplitude polar motion. As a result, the Earth's `angular momentum' will oscillate with respect to one of the body's fixed axis.
