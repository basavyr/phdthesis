\chapter{A New Theoretical Formalism}

In this chapter, a formalism that describes the wobbling properties in odd-$A$ nuclei will be presented. The model was developed recently by the current team (i.e., Raduta and Poenaru) and applied to $^{135}$Pr \cite{raduta2020new}, and the `Lu family' with $^{161,165,167}$Lu \cite{raduta2020approach} and $^{163}$Lu \cite{raduta2020approach,raduta2020towards,poenaru2021parity,poenaru2021extensive1,poenaru2021extensive2}. This framework is an original contribution to the field of nuclear structure and collective phenomena, with focus on the theoretical aspects of them.
