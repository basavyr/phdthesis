\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapter-8-conclusions}

This thesis represents the work of several publications focused on the topic of Nuclear Structure, but on the theoretical side. The study of the nucleonic matter that lacks any axial symmetry was the main objective of the team. Nuclear triaxiality became a hot topic over the last decade due to its challenges of measuring it experimentally. Moreover, the theoretical description of triaxially deformed nuclei requires certain methods or approximations, which can become quite cumbersome.

%ending phrase
Five publications are summarized herein, namely two research papers that introduce the re-normalization in terms of Signature Partner Bands for the first two triaxial bands in $^{161,163,165,167}$Lu (i.e., Refs. \cite{raduta2020approach,raduta2020towards}), two more papers that extends this formalism with the Parity Partner Bands in $^{163}$Lu (that is Refs. \cite{poenaru2021parity,poenaru2021extensive1}), and lastly a paper devoted to the geometry of the wobbling mode in odd-mass nuclei (i.e., Ref. \cite{poenaru2021extensive2}).
