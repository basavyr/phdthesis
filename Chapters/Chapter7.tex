\chapter{Wobbling Motion Study via a Boson Description}
\label{extra-chapter-new-boson}

The last part of this work will be focused on the same wobbling phenomenon, but with a different approach than the ones employed in Chapters \ref{chapter-4-aw1-formalism} and \ref{chapter-5-novel}, as this method does not share the same foundational concepts as the $\mathbf{W_1}$ and $\mathbf{W_2}$ techniques. The results shown here correspond to a recent publication made by the team in Ref. \cite{raduta2020new}, this entire chapter consisting of a summary with all the unique features.

The $\mathbf{W_0}$ formalism studied in Ref. \cite{raduta2017semiclassical} described the wobbling motion for even-even nuclei using a \emph{boson expansion} of the angular momentum components. The Dyson boson representation was chosen \cite{dyson1956general} therein.
