\chapter{Wobbling Motion Study via a Boson Description}
\label{extra-chapter-new-boson}

The last part of this work will be focused on the same wobbling phenomenon, but its description will be based on a different approach than the ones given in Chapters \ref{chapter-4-aw1-formalism} and \ref{chapter-5-novel}. More concisely, this method is does not share the same concepts as the $\mathbf{W_0}$, $\mathbf{W_1}$, and $\mathbf{W_2}$ techniques. The results shown here correspond to a recent publication made by the team \cite{raduta2020new} this entire chapter consisting of a summary for all the unique features of Ref. \cite{raduta2020new}.
