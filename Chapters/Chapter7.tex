\chapter{Wobbling Motion Study via a Boson Description}
\label{extra-chapter-new-boson}

The last part will be focused on the same wobbling phenomenon but with a different approach than the ones employed in Chapters \ref{chapter-4-aw1-formalism} and \ref{chapter-5-novel}, as this method does not share the same foundational concepts as the $\mathbf{W_1}$ and $\mathbf{W_2}$ techniques. The results shown here correspond to a recent publication made by the team in Ref. \cite{raduta2020new}, this entire chapter consisting of a summary with all the unique features.

It is worth recalling a set of results that were achieved by the $\mathbf{W_0}$ formalism. Besides the odd-mass case-study performed by the team in Ref. \cite{raduta2017semiclassical}, the first part consisted in describing wobbling motion for even-even nuclei using a \emph{boson expansion} of the angular momentum components. The problem considered a triaxial rigid rotor with moments of inertia $\mathcal{I}k$, which described by the known rotor Hamiltonian (recall Section \ref{trm-model} and Eq. \ref{general-rotor-hamiltonian}):
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_R=\frac{\hat{R}_1}{2\mathcal{I}_1}+\frac{\hat{R}_2}{2\mathcal{I}_2}+\frac{\hat{R}_3}{2\mathcal{I}_3}\ ,
\end{align}
and angular momentum components $\hat{R}_k$. From this initial quantal problem, a variational principle (similar recipe as the one described in Section \ref{variational-principle-section}, but only for one set of coordinates) brings the system into a classical view, where the eigenvalue problem becomes a system of classical equations in a phase space (see Section II.A and II.B from Ref. \cite{raduta2017semiclassical}). Summarizing the calculations, one obtained $i)$ a pair of conjugate variables (i.e., $r$ and $\varphi$) and $ii)$ two equations of motion (recall discussion from Section \ref{equations-of-motion-section} and Eq. \ref{eq-of-motion-approach-w1}) as:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial r}=\dot{\varphi}\ ,\ \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial\varphi}=-\dot{r}\ ,
\end{align}
with $\mathcal{H}$ as the average of $\hat{H}_R$ with the trial function. If the average values of the angular momentum components are expressed in terms of the phase space coordinates $(r,\varphi)$, then the following equations emerge:
\begin{align}
    J_+^\text{cls}&\equiv\langle\hat{R}_+\rangle=\sqrt{r(2I-r)}e^{\iu\varphi}\ ,\nonumber \\
    J_-^\text{cls}&\equiv\langle\hat{R}_-\rangle=\sqrt{r(2I-r)}e^{-\iu\varphi}\ ,\nonumber \\
    J_3^\text{cls}&\equiv\langle\hat{R}_3\rangle=r-I\ .
    \label{classical-am-components-boson}
\end{align} 

Their algebra being governed by the Poisson brackets, which defines their inner product:
\begin{align}
    \left\{J_+^\text{cls},J_-^\text{cls}\right\}=-2\iu J_3^\text{cls}\ ,\ \left\{J_\pm^\text{cls},J_3^\text{cls}\right\}=\pm\iu J_{\pm}^\text{cls}\ .
    \label{classical-J-poisson-brackets}
\end{align} 

The three functions $J_+^\text{cls}$, $J_-^\text{cls}$, $J_3^\text{cls}$ together with the Poisson brackets from Eq. \ref{classical-J-poisson-brackets} generate a classical algebra $\left[\text{SU}(2)\right]_\text{cls}$. A pair of complex functions $f$ and $g$ defined in this classical phase space will have their associated Poisson bracket:
\begin{align}
    \left\{f,g\right\}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial \varphi}\frac{\partial g}{\partial r} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\frac{\partial g}{\partial \varphi}\ .
\end{align} 

The classical coordinates belonging to that phase space were then re-quantized through the \emph{Dyson boson expansion} \cite{dyson1956general}, which signified a change of the picture from the classical $\left[\text{SU}(2)\right]_\text{cls}$ back to a quantized view. Firstly, the quantization starts with two canonical complex variables written in terms of the conjugate coordinates $(r, \varphi)$:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{C}=\sqrt{2I}\sqrt{r^{-1}(2I-r)}e^{-\iu\varphi}\ ,\nonumber\\
    \mathcal{B}^*=\sqrt{2I}^{-1}\sqrt{r(2I-r)}e^{\iu\varphi}\ ,
    \label{complex-variables-dyson}
\end{align}
and the Poisson bracket:
\begin{align}
    \left\{\mathcal{B}^*,\mathcal{C}\right\}=\iu\ .
\end{align}

The quantization process within the Dyson representation implies that a new set of quantal operators $b$ and $b^\dagger$ should replace the two complex coordinates, and the inner product defined by the Poisson bracket becomes the commutator operator:
\begin{align}
    \left(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{B}^*,\{,\}\right)\Longrightarrow\left(b,b^\dagger,-\iu \left[,\right]\right)\ .
    \label{dyson-transformation}
\end{align} 

The transformation employed in Eq. \ref{dyson-transformation} will introduce the following set of angular momentum components:
\begin{align}
    \hat{J}_+^\text{D}&=\sqrt{2I}b^\dagger\ ,\nonumber\\
    \hat{J}_-^\text{D}&=\sqrt{2I}\left(1-\frac{b^\dagger b}{2I}\right)b\ ,\nonumber\\
    \hat{J}_3^\text{D}&=I-b^\dagger b\ .
    \label{dyson-boson-expansion-am-components}
\end{align}

The set of angular momentum components $\hat{J}^\text{D}$ provided in Eq. \ref{dyson-boson-expansion-am-components} marks the onset of the Dyson boson representation. A function that depends on the variables from Eq. \ref{complex-variables-dyson} can be quantized by first writing its expression in terms of $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{B}^*$ and then replace both variables by the boson operators $b$ and $b^\dagger$. The transformation is boson like because of the nature of $b$ and $b^\dagger$. These operators obey the boson canonical commutation relations:
\begin{align}
    \left[b,b^\dagger\right]=1\ ,\ \left[b,b\right]=\left[b^\dagger,b^\dagger\right]=0\ .
    \label{boson-commutation-relations}
\end{align}

Remarkable that this is the first time within literature when this kind of representation is successfully applied to odd-$A$ nuclei.
