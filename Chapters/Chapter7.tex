\chapter{Wobbling Motion Study via a Boson Description}
\label{extra-chapter-new-boson}

The last part of this work will be focused on the same wobbling phenomenon, but its description will be based on a different approach than the ones given in Chapters \ref{chapter-4-concluding-remarks} and \ref{chapter-5-novel}. More concisely, this method is different than the $\mathbf{W_0}$, $\mathbf{W_1}$, and $\mathbf{W_2}$ techniques.
