\chapter{Wobbling Motion Study via a Boson Description}
\label{extra-chapter-new-boson}

The last part will be focused on the same wobbling phenomenon but with a different approach than the ones employed in Chapters \ref{chapter-4-aw1-formalism} and \ref{chapter-5-novel}, as this method does not share the same foundational concepts as the $\mathbf{W_1}$ and $\mathbf{W_2}$ techniques. The results shown here correspond to a recent publication made by the team in Ref. \cite{raduta2020new}, this entire chapter consisting of a summary with all the unique features.

The $\mathbf{W_0}$ formalism developed by the team in Ref. \cite{raduta2017semiclassical} described the wobbling motion for even-even nuclei using a \emph{boson expansion} of the angular momentum components. The initial problem consisted in a triaxial rigid rotor with moments of inertia $\mathcal{I}k$, which described by the known rotor Hamiltonian (recall Section \ref{trm-model} and Eq. \ref{general-rotor-hamiltonian}):
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_R=\frac{\hat{R}_1}{2\mathcal{I}_1}+\frac{\hat{R}_2}{2\mathcal{I}_2}+\frac{\hat{R}_3}{2\mathcal{I}_3}\ ,
\end{align}
and angular momentum components $\hat{R}_k$. From this initial quantal problem, a variational principle brings the system into a classical view, where the eigenvalue problem becomes a system of classical equations in a phase space (see Section II.A and II.B from Ref. \cite{raduta2017semiclassical}). Furthermore, the classical coordinates belonging to that phase space were re-quantized through the Dyson boson expansion \cite{dyson1956general}. Starting with two canonical complex variables:
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{C}=\sqrt{2I}\sqrt{\frac{2I-r}{r}}e^{-\iu\varphi}\ ,\nonumber\\
    \mathcal{B}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2I}}\sqrt{(2I-r)(r)}e^{\iu\varphi}\ ,
\end{align} 


Remarkable that this is the first time within literature when this kind of representation is successfully applied to odd-$A$ nuclei.
