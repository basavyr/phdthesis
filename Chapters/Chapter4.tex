\chapter{Triaxial Nuclei and Their Signatures}

In the following chapter, some theoretical background that is necessary for understanding triaxiality will be presented, with examples from literature and also some results obtained by this team. It is also instructive to realize why the nuclear community focuses their attention to the highly deformed nuclei, and moreover, nuclei which depart so much from the spherical shapes that they become \emph{triaxial}.

Presenting the theoretical formalism that is used to describe triaxial nuclei, and mention the \emph{fingerprints} of nuclear triaxiality is that last step before diving into the recently developed framework for odd-$A$ nuclei which the team created.
