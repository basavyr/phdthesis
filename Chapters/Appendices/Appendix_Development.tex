\chapter{Development Tools}
\label{appendix:dev-tools}

For the entire period of the doctoral studies, a multitude of programming applications and numerical software was used, adopted, and implemented in order to facilitate the research process and achieve the desired results.

\begin{description}
    \item[Writing language] The thesis and all of the papers were written using the \LaTeX {} language \cite{lamport1986latex}. This document was typeset using the TeXLive distribution for macOS \cite{texlivemacos}.
    \item[Editing software] Even though \LaTeX {} was adopted as the typeset language, the environment for writing the content itself was chosen to be \textbf{Visual Studio Code} \cite{vscode}. In fact, VS Code was also the main editor for most of the numerical methods developed for each objective of the conducted research.
    \item[Programming Languages] Testing the formalisms that were employed throughout the papers required lots of numerical algorithms (e.g., fitting procedures, differential equations, integrating functions). As a result, most of the work performed by the student was to develop code in different programming languages with the main goal of obtaining some results.
